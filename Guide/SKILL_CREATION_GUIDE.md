## What Are Skills?

### Definition

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. They transform Claude from a general-purpose assistant into a specialized expert equipped with procedural knowledge and domain expertise.

### What Skills Provide

1. **Specialized Workflows** - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. **Tool Integrations** - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. **Domain Expertise** - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, and business logic
4. **Bundled Resources** - Scripts, references, and assets for complex repetitive tasks

### Types of Skills You Can Create

- **API Integration Skills** - Connect to external services (like our Spotify skill)
- **Document Processing** - Work with DOCX, PDF, XLSX files
- **Code Generation** - Templates and boilerplate for specific frameworks
- **Business Logic** - Company processes, policies, and workflows
- **Data Analysis** - Database schemas, query templates
- **Specialized Tools** - Domain-specific utilities and helpers
- **Brand Guidelines** - Assets, templates, and styling rules
- **Learning Materials** - Structured educational content

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Concise is Key 🎯

The context window is shared across:
- System prompt
- Conversation history
- Other skills' metadata
- User request
- Your skill content

**Rule**: Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge every sentence: "Does Claude really need this?"

**Good Practice**: Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations.

```markdown
# ❌ Bad (Too verbose)
The Spotify API is a web service provided by Spotify that allows 
developers to access music data and control playback through HTTP 
requests. OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol...

# ✅ Good (Concise)
Use SpotifyClient with OAuth 2.0 credentials. Token auto-refreshes.
```

### 2. Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom 🛣️

Match specificity to task complexity:

**High Freedom** (Text-based instructions)
- Use when: Multiple approaches are valid
- Example: "Create a blog post" - many valid styles
- Token cost: Low (guidance only)

```markdown
# Blog Post Guide
Consider your audience, tone, and structure.
Format with headers, examples, and clear sections.
```

**Medium Freedom** (Pseudocode with parameters)
- Use when: Preferred pattern exists but variation is OK
- Example: "Process user data" - structure matters but implementation varies
- Token cost: Medium

```python
def process_data(input_file, **options):
    # Template showing structure
    load_data()
    transform_data(**options)
    save_results()
```

**Low Freedom** (Specific scripts, few parameters)
- Use when: Operations are fragile or must be consistent
- Example: "Rotate PDF by 90 degrees" - single best way
- Token cost: Higher but necessary

```python
# Exact script to be executed
def rotate_pdf(input_path, degrees, output_path):
    # Precise implementation
```

**Analogy**: A narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), an open field allows many routes (high freedom).

### 3. Context Window Efficiency 💾

Skills use **Progressive Disclosure** - load content as needed:

1. **Level 1: Metadata** (~100 words) - Always loaded
   - Skill name and description
   - Used for skill selection

2. **Level 2: SKILL.md** (~5k words) - Loaded when skill triggers
   - Main usage guide
   - Common patterns and examples
   - References to deeper content

3. **Level 3: Resources** (Unlimited) - Loaded on-demand
   - Scripts can execute without loading
   - References loaded only when needed
   - Assets used directly in output

### 4. Single Source of Truth

Information should live in ONE place:

```
✅ SKILL.md: Essential workflows and quick examples
✅ references/api_guide.md: Detailed API documentation
✅ scripts/process.py: Reusable code implementation
✅ assets/template.docx: Output templates

❌ DON'T: Duplicate same info in multiple files
```

## Skill Architecture

### Directory Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md                    # Required: Main documentation
├── scripts/                    # Optional: Executable code
│   ├── main_script.py
│   └── helper_script.py
├── references/                 # Optional: Reference documentation

    ├── template.docx
    └── logo.png
```

### What Each Component Does

#### SKILL.md (Required)

**Contains:**
- YAML frontmatter (name, description)
- Main usage guide
- Quick start examples
- Links to detailed resources

**Size**: <5,000 words (< 500 lines)
**Purpose**: Quick reference and navigation

**Example YAML Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
name: spotify-api
description: Connect to Spotify API and manage playlists, search music, 
control playback, and create intelligent playlists by artist, theme, 
lyrics, or specific songs. Handles OAuth authentication and provides 
40+ methods for playlist management, search, user data, and playback control.
---
```

**Best Practices for SKILL.md:**
- Start with overview (1-2 sentences)
- Provide quick start with code
- Show common workflows
- Reference deeper docs
- Use examples liberally
- Keep it navigable

#### Scripts Folder (Optional)

**For:** Reusable, deterministic code that gets executed

**When to Use:**
- Code that's written repeatedly
- Complex operations needing reliability
- Performance-critical tasks
- Encapsulated logic

**Example:**
```python
# scripts/spotify_client.py
class SpotifyClient:
    def __init__(self, credentials):
        self.credentials = credentials
    
    def get_user_playlists(self, limit=50):
        # Implementation
        pass
```

**Benefits:**
- Token efficient (execute without loading)
- Maintains consistency
- Easier to version and update
- Can be tested independently

#### References Folder (Optional)

**For:** Documentation to reference while working

**When to Use:**
- API endpoint documentation
- Database schemas
- Detailed workflow guides
- Company policies
- Data structures

**Example:**
```
references/
├── api_reference.md       # All endpoints
├── authentication.md      # OAuth setup
└── data_schemas.md        # Table structures
```

**Design Pattern:**
```markdown
# Main SKILL.md
Quick start section...

## Advanced Usage
See references/advanced_guide.md

## API Reference
See references/api_endpoints.md
```

#### Assets Folder (Optional)

**For:** Files used in output (NOT loaded to context)

**When to Use:**
- Templates (DOCX, PPTX)
- Images and logos
- Fonts
- Boilerplate code
- Sample documents

**Example:**
```
assets/
├── slides_template.pptx
├── logo.png
└── frontend_boilerplate/
    ├── index.html
    └── style.css
```

**Benefits:**
- Claude can use without loading into context
- Faster processing
- Large files stay out of context window

### What NOT to Include

Don't add extraneous files:
- ❌ README.md (use SKILL.md)
- ❌ INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md (put in SKILL.md)
- ❌ CHANGELOG.md (not for Claude)
- ❌ TODO.md (internal notes)
- ❌ Duplicate documentation
- ❌ Unnecessary helper files

## 6-Step Creation Process

### Step 1: Understand the Skill with Concrete Examples

**Goal:** Crystal clear understanding of what the skill does

**Questions to Ask:**

1. **Scope**: What functionality should this skill support?
   - Example: "Spotify skill: Create playlists, search music, control playback"

2. **Use Cases**: What would users say?
   - "Create a playlist of The Beatles songs"
   - "Build a chill evening playlist"
   - "What's currently playing?"

3. **Variations**: What different ways will users need it?
   - "Create playlists by artist, theme, lyrics, or specific songs"

4. **Constraints**: What are the limits?
   - "Spotify API rate limits: 429,400 requests per 30 minutes"

**Example Exercise for Spotify**:

| Use Case | Trigger | Required Knowledge |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Create artist playlist | "Make Beatles playlist" | Search API, artist top tracks, playlist creation |
| Create mood playlist | "Build chill playlist" | Search with keywords, track filtering |
| Control playback | "Play next song" | Device management, playback API |
| Get recommendations | "Suggest songs like..." | Recommendations engine, seed parameters |

**Output**: Written list of 5-10 concrete use cases

### Step 2: Plan Reusable Skill Contents

**Goal:** Identify what resources you'll need

**For Each Use Case, Ask:**

1. "How would I do this from scratch?"
2. "What code would I write repeatedly?"
3. "What reference material would help?"
4. "What templates or assets would I need?"

**Spotify Example Analysis:**

| Use Case | Reusable Content Needed |
|----------|----------------------|
| Create artist playlist | spotify_client.py (search artists), (get top tracks), (create playlist) |
| Create mood playlist | spotify_client.py (search with keywords), playlist_creator.py (intelligent creation) |
| Control playback | spotify_client.py (playback methods) |
| All | authentication_guide.md, api_reference.md |

**Output**: Plan for scripts, references, and assets

```
Scripts:
  - spotify_client.py (40+ API methods)
  - playlist_creator.py (intelligent creation)

References:
  - authentication_guide.md (OAuth setup)
  - api_reference.md (endpoints)

Assets:
  - None needed
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Skill

**Goal:** Create the skill directory structure

**Command:**
```bash
python3 /mnt/skills/examples/skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>
```

**Example:**
```bash
python3 /mnt/skills/examples/skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py spotify-api --path /home/claude/skills
```

**What It Creates:**
```
spotify-api/
├── SKILL.md (template with TODO)
├── scripts/
│   └── example.py (delete if not needed)
├── references/
│   └── api_reference.md (template)
└── assets/
    └── example_asset.txt (delete if not needed)
```

**Next Steps:**
- Review generated files
- Delete unused templates
- Plan implementation

### Step 4: Edit the Skill

**Goal:** Implement and document the skill

#### 4a. Implement Reusable Resources

**Start with Scripts:**
1. Create each script from your plan
2. Test thoroughly
3. Add comprehensive docstrings
4. Include error handling

**Example** (spotify_client.py):
```python
class SpotifyClient:
    """Authenticated Spotify Web API client."""
    
    def __init__(self, client_id: str, client_secret: str):
        """Initialize with credentials."""
        self.client_id = client_id
        self.client_secret = client_secret
    
    def get_user_playlists(self, limit: int = 50) -> List[Dict]:
        """Get user's playlists.
        
        Args:
            limit: Number of playlists (max 50)
            
        Returns:
            List of playlist objects
        """
        # Implementation with error handling
```

**Create References:**
1. Organize by topic
2. Include examples
3. Add tables/structures
4. Use clear headers

**Prepare Assets:**
1. Gather templates
2. Ensure they're production-ready
3. Test in actual output

#### 4b. Write SKILL.md

**Structure Template:**

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: What it does and when to use it. Include specific keywords.
---

# Skill Title

## Overview
1-2 sentences explaining what it enables.

## Core Capabilities
List 5-10 main features.

## Quick Start
Code example with minimal setup.

## Common Workflows
3-5 workflow sections with examples.

## Advanced Features
Link to reference files for deep dives.

## References
- `references/guide1.md` - For X
- `references/guide2.md` - For Y
```

**Writing Guidelines:**
- Use imperative form ("Do this", not "You can do this")
- Lead with benefits
- Provide working code examples
- Link to detailed resources
- Keep body <5,000 words

**Description Best Practices:**
- Be specific (not "work with APIs" but "connect to Spotify API")
- Include key terms (helps skill selection)
- Mention when to use it
- Include main features

```
❌ Bad: "API integration skill for music"

✅ Good: "Connect to Spotify API and manage playlists, search music, 
control playback, and create intelligent playlists by artist, theme, 
lyrics, or specific songs. Handles OAuth authentication and provides 
40+ methods for playlist management."
```

### Step 5: Package the Skill

**Goal:** Create distributable .skill file

**Command:**
```bash
python3 /mnt/skills/examples/skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>
```

**Optional Output Directory:**
```bash
python3 /mnt/skills/examples/skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist
```

**What Happens:**
1. **Validates** the skill:
   - YAML frontmatter format
   - Required fields present
   - Description quality
   - File organization

2. **Packages** into .skill file (ZIP with .skill extension)

3. **Preserves** directory structure

**If Validation Fails:**
- Fix reported errors
- Re-run packaging
- Check for:
  - Missing YAML fields
  - Invalid skill names
  - Poor descriptions
  - Broken references

### Step 6: Iterate Based on Usage

**Goal:** Improve based on real-world usage

**Iteration Cycle:**
1. **Use** the skill on actual tasks
2. **Observe** what works and what doesn't
3. **Identify** needed improvements
4. **Update** SKILL.md or resources
5. **Test** changes
6. **Repackage** if needed

**Common Improvements:**
- Clearer examples
- Better error handling
- Additional methods
- More reference material
- Better organization

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Create skill directory
mkdir -p ~/skills/my-skill/scripts
mkdir -p ~/skills/my-skill/references
mkdir -p ~/skills/my-skill/assets

# Initialize with script
python3 /mnt/skills/examples/skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path ~/skills
```

### 2. Implement Scripts

**Best Practices:**

```python
# ✅ Good: Clear, documented, tested

class MyClient:
    """Client for external service."""
    
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        """Initialize with credentials.
        
        Args:
            api_key: Authentication key
            
        Raises:
            ValueError: If api_key is empty
        """
        if not api_key:
            raise ValueError("API key required")
        self.api_key = api_key
    
    def fetch_data(self, resource_id: str) -> Dict:
        """Fetch data for resource.
        
        Args:
            resource_id: ID of resource
            
        Returns:
            Dictionary with resource data
            
        Raises:
            requests.HTTPError: If request fails
        """
        try:
            response = requests.get(
                f"https://api.example.com/{resource_id}",
                headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}"}
            )
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            raise ValueError(f"Failed to fetch data: {e}")

# Test your implementation
if __name__ == "__main__":
    client = MyClient(api_key="test_key")
    data = client.fetch_data("resource_123")
    print(data)
```

### 3. Create Reference Documentation

**Structure:**

```markdown
# API Reference

## Table of Contents
1. [Authentication](#authentication)
2. [Endpoints](#endpoints)
3. [Error Handling](#error-handling)

## Authentication
Explain how to authenticate...

## Endpoints
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|

## Error Handling
Common errors and solutions...
```

### 4. Write SKILL.md

**Template:**

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Specific description of what skill does and when to use it.
---

# My Skill

## Overview
One or two sentences explaining what this skill enables.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Feature One** - What it does
2. **Feature Two** - What it does
3. **Feature Three** - What it does

## Quick Start

```python
from my_module import MyClient

client = MyClient(api_key="your_key")
data = client.fetch_data("resource_id")
print(data)
```

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Basic Operation

```python
# Example code
result = client.do_something()
```

See `references/advanced_guide.md` for more details.

### Workflow 2: Complex Operation

```python
# Example code
result = client.do_complex_thing(option="value")
```

## References

- `references/api_reference.md` - Full API documentation
- `references/authentication.md` - Setup guide
```

### 5. Test and Validate

```bash
# Validate before packaging
python3 /mnt/skills/examples/skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py ./my-skill

# Test imports
python3 -c "from my_skill.scripts.my_module import MyClient; print('Success!')"

# Run example code
python3 ./my-skill/scripts/example_test.py
```

### 6. Package and Distribute

```bash
# Create .skill file
python3 /mnt/skills/examples/skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py ./my-skill ./dist

# Verify package
unzip -l ./dist/my-skill.skill
```

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

1. **Keep SKILL.md concise** - <5,000 words
2. **Provide working examples** - Users should copy-paste
3. **Document assumptions** - "Requires Python 3.7+"
4. **Test scripts thoroughly** - Before packaging
5. **Use clear naming** - `spotify_client.py`, not `sc.py`
6. **Add error handling** - Helpful error messages
7. **Reference related resources** - Link between docs
8. **Update based on feedback** - Iterate and improve
9. **Use imperative language** - "Create", not "You can create"
10. **Include security info** - How to handle credentials

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Duplicate documentation** - One source of truth
2. **Include unnecessary files** - Keep it lean
3. **Write verbose explanations** - Assume Claude is smart
4. **Leave scripts untested** - Run before packaging
5. **Use vague names** - Be specific
6. **Hide errors** - Let them surface
7. **Create circular references** - Avoid A→B→A links
8. **Forget about rate limits** - Document constraints
9. **Hard-code credentials** - Use environment variables
10. **Over-document** - Every paragraph should justify its existence

### Performance Tips

1. **Batch operations** - When possible
2. **Cache results** - Reduce API calls
3. **Lazy load resources** - Load only when needed
4. **Minimize script size** - Remove dead code
5. **Use async** - For I/O-bound operations

### Security Tips

1. **Never embed secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Validate inputs** - Check all parameters
3. **Document scopes** - What permissions needed?
4. **Handle errors gracefully** - Don't expose internals
5. **Use HTTPS** - Always for APIs

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: High-Level Guide with References

```
SKILL.md
├── Quick Start (code example)
└── See references/ for details
    ├── references/advanced.md
    ├── references/api.md
    └── references/setup.md
```

**Use When**: Skill has many options/frameworks

### Pattern 2: Domain-Specific Organization

```
SKILL.md (Overview)
references/
├── finance.md (revenue, billing)
├── sales.md (opportunities)
└── support.md (tickets, cases)
```

**Use When**: Multiple distinct domains

### Pattern 3: Workflow with Templates

```
SKILL.md (Main workflows)
scripts/
├── template.py (base template)
├── workflow1.py (variant A)
└── workflow2.py (variant B)
assets/
├── template.docx
└── example_output.pdf
```

**Use When**: Document generation or coding tasks

### Pattern 4: API Client Wrapper

```
SKILL.md (Overview)
scripts/
├── client.py (main API wrapper)
├── auth.py (authentication)
└── utils.py (helpers)
references/
├── api_reference.md (endpoints)
└── authentication.md (setup)
```

**Use When**: Integrating external APIs

---

## Troubleshooting

### Package Validation Errors

**"YAML frontmatter format invalid"**
```yaml
# ❌ Wrong
description This is my skill

# ✅ Correct
---
name: my-skill
description: This is my skill
---
```

**"Required field 'description' missing"**
```yaml
# Must have:
---
name: my-skill
description: Clear description of what skill does
---
```

**"Description too vague"**
```
❌ "Document processing skill"
✅ "Create and modify Word documents (.docx) with tracked changes, 
   comments, and formatted text. Handle document creation, editing, 
   merging, and analysis."
```

### Script Errors

**ImportError when packaging**
```python
# Check imports are available
import requests  # Install if needed: pip install requests

# Use absolute imports
from spotify_client import SpotifyClient  # ✅
from .spotify_client import SpotifyClient  # ✅ (relative)
```

**Reference links broken**
```markdown
# ❌ Wrong (file doesn't exist)
See references/nonexistent.md

# ✅ Correct (file exists)
See references/api_guide.md
```

### Performance Issues

**SKILL.md too large**
- Move detailed examples to references/
- Create separate guides
- Use summary tables

**Scripts loading slowly**
- Break into smaller modules
- Use lazy imports
- Document execution expectations

### Context Window Usage

**SKILL.md exceeding 5,000 words**
```
Total: 8,000 words → TOO LARGE

Move to references/:
- Detailed examples (3,000 words)
- Advanced options (2,000 words)
- Troubleshooting (1,000 words)

Keep in SKILL.md:
- Overview
- Quick start
- Common workflows
- Navigation
```
