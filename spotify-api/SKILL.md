# Spotify API Skill

**Version**: 0.9.0 | **Release Date**: October 22, 2025

## Overview

**This skill directly interacts with the Spotify Web API to manage music and playlists.**

### ‚ö° Unique Capability: Image Generation

**üé® This skill can GENERATE IMAGES** - something Claude cannot do natively! It creates custom SVG-based cover art for Spotify playlists with large, readable typography optimized for thumbnail viewing. Each cover art is dynamically generated with theme-appropriate colors, gradients, and text layouts.

Use this skill when you need to:
- üé® **Generate cover art images** - Create custom playlist covers (Claude's built-in image generation limitation is bypassed!)
- üéµ **Create playlists** from artist names, themes, or specific songs
- üîç **Search** for tracks, artists, albums
- ‚ûï **Add/remove tracks** from playlists
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Control playback** (play, pause, skip)
- üìä **Get user data** (profile, top tracks, listening history)

**When to use this skill:** The user wants you to create a playlist, search for music, manage their Spotify account, **or generate custom cover art images**.

## Core Capabilities

1. **üé® Cover Art Image Generation** - Generate custom images with SVG ‚Üí PNG conversion (Claude cannot generate images natively!)
2. **Intelligent Playlist Creation** - Create playlists by artist, theme, lyrics, or song list
3. **Playlist Management** - Create, list, update, delete playlists
4. **Search & Discovery** - Find tracks, artists, albums, playlists
5. **Track Management** - Add/remove tracks, get recommendations
6. **Playback Control** - Play, pause, skip, control volume
7. **User Library** - Access saved tracks, profile, listening history

## Quick Start

All Spotify API operations use the `SpotifyClient` class from `scripts/spotify_client.py`. The client handles OAuth authentication and provides methods for all operations.

### Prerequisites

**1. Enable Network Access (REQUIRED)**

‚ö†Ô∏è **This skill requires network access to reach api.spotify.com**

In Claude Desktop, you must enable network egress:
- Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Developer** ‚Üí **Allow network egress**
- Toggle it **ON** (blue)
- Under "Domain allowlist", choose either:
  - **"All domains"** (easiest), OR
  - **"Specified domains"** and add `api.spotify.com` (more secure/restricted)
- This allows the skill to make API calls to Spotify's servers

Without network access enabled, API calls will fail with connection errors.

**2. Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- `requests>=2.31.0` - HTTP requests for Spotify Web API
- `python-dotenv>=1.0.0` - Environment variable management
- `cairosvg>=2.7.0` - SVG to PNG conversion for **image generation**
- `pillow>=10.0.0` - Image processing for **cover art creation**

> **üí° Note:** The `cairosvg` and `pillow` packages enable **image generation** - allowing this skill to create cover art images even though Claude cannot generate images natively!

### Basic Setup

The easiest way to initialize the client is using credentials from environment variables (loaded from `.env` file):

```python
from spotify_client import create_client_from_env

# Initialize client from environment variables (.env file)
client = create_client_from_env()

# If you have a refresh token, refresh the access token
if client.refresh_token:
    client.refresh_access_token()
```

Alternatively, you can manually provide credentials:

```python
from spotify_client import SpotifyClient

# Initialize with credentials directly
client = SpotifyClient(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    redirect_uri="http://localhost:8888/callback",
    refresh_token="YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"  # if available
)

# Refresh to get current access token
if client.refresh_token:
    client.refresh_access_token()
```

### Common Operations

**List user playlists:**
```python
playlists = client.get_user_playlists(limit=50)
```

**Create a new playlist:**
```python
playlist = client.create_playlist(
    name="My Awesome Playlist",
    description="A curated collection",
    public=True
)
```

**Search for tracks:**
```python
results = client.search_tracks(query="artist:The Beatles", limit=20)
```

**Add tracks to playlist:**
```python
client.add_tracks_to_playlist(
    playlist_id="playlist_123",
    track_ids=["track_1", "track_2", "track_3"]
)
```

## Playlist Creation Workflows

### By Artist/Band Name

Create a playlist containing all or most popular tracks by a specific artist:

```python
# STEP 1: Search for the artist by name
artists = client.search_artists(query="The Beatles", limit=1)
if not artists:
    print("Artist not found")
    # Handle error: artist doesn't exist or name is misspelled
else:
    artist_id = artists[0]['id']  # Get Spotify ID of first result

    # STEP 2: Get the artist's most popular tracks
    # Spotify returns up to 10 top tracks per country
    tracks = client.get_artist_top_tracks(artist_id=artist_id, limit=50)
    track_ids = [t['id'] for t in tracks]  # Extract just the track IDs

    # STEP 3: Create a new playlist and add the tracks
    playlist = client.create_playlist(name="The Beatles Collection")
    client.add_tracks_to_playlist(playlist['id'], track_ids)
    print(f"Created playlist with {len(track_ids)} tracks")
```
```

### By Theme/Mood

Create thematic playlists by searching for tracks matching mood keywords:

```python
# STEP 1: Define search queries for your theme
# Spotify search syntax: "genre:indie mood:chill" or "genre:indie year:2020-2024"
theme_queries = [
    "genre:indie mood:chill",      # Search for chill indie tracks
    "genre:indie year:2020-2024"   # Search for recent indie tracks
]

# STEP 2: Search for tracks matching each query
all_tracks = []
for query in theme_queries:
    results = client.search_tracks(query=query, limit=50)  # Get up to 50 per query
    all_tracks.extend(results)  # Combine results from all queries

# Note: all_tracks may contain duplicates if same track matches multiple queries

# STEP 3: Create playlist with the first 100 tracks (Spotify batch limit)
playlist = client.create_playlist(name="Chill Indie Evening")
track_ids = [t['id'] for t in all_tracks[:100]]  # Limit to first 100 tracks
client.add_tracks_to_playlist(playlist['id'], track_ids)
print(f"Created playlist with {len(track_ids)} tracks")
```
```

### By Lyrics Content

Search for tracks with specific lyrical themes using Spotify's search:

```python
# STEP 1: Define keywords related to lyrical content
# Note: Spotify search indexes track/artist names and some metadata,
# not full lyrics, so results are based on title/description matching
queries = ["love", "heartbreak", "summer", "midnight"]

# STEP 2: Search for tracks matching each keyword
all_tracks = []
for keyword in queries:
    results = client.search_tracks(query=keyword, limit=20)  # 20 tracks per keyword
    all_tracks.extend(results)

# STEP 3: Remove duplicates (same track may match multiple keywords)
# Use set() with track IDs to keep only unique tracks
unique_track_ids = list(set(t['id'] for t in all_tracks))
print(f"Found {len(all_tracks)} total matches, {len(unique_track_ids)} unique tracks")

# STEP 4: Create playlist (limit to 100 tracks for reasonable size)
playlist = client.create_playlist(name="Love & Heartbreak")
client.add_tracks_to_playlist(playlist['id'], unique_track_ids[:100])
```
```

### From Specific Song List

Create a playlist from a user-provided list of track URIs or search terms:

```python
# STEP 1: Get the list of songs from the user
# User provides song names (can also use Spotify URIs like "spotify:track:...")
song_list = ["Shape of You", "Blinding Lights", "As It Was"]

# STEP 2: Search for each song and collect track IDs
track_ids = []
for song_name in song_list:
    results = client.search_tracks(query=song_name, limit=1)  # Get best match
    if results:
        track_ids.append(results[0]['id'])  # Add first result's ID
        print(f"‚úì Found: {results[0]['name']} by {results[0]['artists'][0]['name']}")
    else:
        print(f"‚úó Not found: {song_name}")  # Song doesn't exist or name is wrong

# STEP 3: Create playlist with found tracks
playlist = client.create_playlist(name="My Favorites")
if track_ids:
    client.add_tracks_to_playlist(playlist['id'], track_ids)
    print(f"Created playlist with {len(track_ids)}/{len(song_list)} tracks")
else:
    print("No tracks found - playlist is empty")
```
```

## üé® Cover Art Image Generation

> **‚ö° UNIQUE CAPABILITY: This skill can generate images!**
>
> Claude cannot generate images natively, but this skill bypasses that limitation by creating custom SVG graphics and converting them to PNG images. This enables you to generate professional-looking playlist cover art with:
> - Large, readable typography (60-96px fonts) optimized for thumbnails
> - **Automatic text wrapping** - Long titles break across multiple lines intelligently
> - **Content-driven color selection** - Analyze playlist tracks/artists to determine appropriate colors
> - Automatic layout optimization with 80% text width
> - Smart element spacing to prevent overlap
> - SVG ‚Üí PNG conversion with auto-optimization for Spotify's requirements
>
> **This is real image generation**, not just visualization descriptions!

> **ÔøΩ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR COVER ART GENERATION:**
>
> **‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS read [references/COVER_ART_LLM_GUIDE.md](references/COVER_ART_LLM_GUIDE.md) FIRST before generating any cover art!**
>
> This guide is REQUIRED reading and contains the complete execution instructions for content-driven design. DO NOT generate cover art without consulting this guide first.

> **ÔøΩüìã RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW - Content-Driven Design:**
>
> **The best approach is to analyze the playlist's actual content to determine colors:**
>
> 1. **READ THE GUIDE FIRST** - Open and read [references/COVER_ART_LLM_GUIDE.md](references/COVER_ART_LLM_GUIDE.md)
> 2. **Analyze Playlist Content** - Get the playlist's tracks and artists using the Spotify API
> 3. **Extract Characteristics** - Determine genre, energy level (1-10), and mood from the actual content
> 4. **Apply Color Psychology** - Use the color mapping tables in the guide to choose appropriate colors
> 5. **Generate with Custom Colors** - Pass determined colors to the generator
>
> **üìö THE LLM GUIDE CONTAINS:** [references/COVER_ART_LLM_GUIDE.md](references/COVER_ART_LLM_GUIDE.md)
> - Complete step-by-step execution process
> - How to analyze playlist content using the Spotify API
> - Genre-to-color mapping tables (rock ‚Üí red, jazz ‚Üí purple, etc.)
> - Mood-to-color mapping tables (energetic ‚Üí orange, chill ‚Üí blue, etc.)
> - Energy level analysis (1-10 scale)
> - Color psychology principles
> - Typography rules and accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
> - Complete workflow examples with code
> - Edge case handling (long titles, special characters)
> - Quality assurance checklist
>
> **Example: Content-Driven Approach**
> ```python
> # 1. Get playlist content
> playlist = client.get_playlist(playlist_id)
> tracks = playlist['tracks']['items']
> artists = [track['track']['artists'][0]['name'] for track in tracks if track['track']]
>
> # 2. Analyze content (you determine from artists/genres)
> # Artists: Metallica, Rage Against the Machine, Linkin Park
> # Detected: High-energy rock/metal, aggressive mood
> # Energy: 9/10
>
> # 3. Determine colors using color psychology
> gradient_start = "#E63946"  # Intense red (high energy, aggressive)
> gradient_end = "#1D1D1D"    # Almost black (metal aesthetic)
> text_color = "#FFFFFF"      # Maximum contrast
>
> # 4. Generate with determined colors
> art_gen.create_and_upload_cover(
>     playlist_id=playlist['id'],
>     title="Beast Mode Gym",
>     gradient_start=gradient_start,
>     gradient_end=gradient_end,
>     text_color=text_color
> )
> ```

> **ÔøΩ ALTERNATIVE: Quick Presets (Legacy)**
>
> For quick usage without content analysis, preset themes are available:
>
> 1. **For Vague Requests** - If the playlist name is generic ("My Playlist", "Good Music"), ASK clarifying questions:
>    - What genres are in this playlist?
>    - What's the mood or context? (workout, relaxation, party, study)
>
> 2. **For Long Titles** (>25 characters) - Text wrapping is automatic
>
> 3. **Always Verify** - Confirm the design is readable and appropriate

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Required Scope for Upload

**To upload cover art to Spotify, you MUST have the `ugc-image-upload` scope enabled:**

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Select your app
3. Ensure `ugc-image-upload` scope is included in your authorization
4. Re-run OAuth flow to get a new refresh token with this scope: `python get_refresh_token.py`
5. Update your `.env` file with the new refresh token

**Without this scope:** You'll get a 401 error when trying to upload. However, you can still **generate cover art images locally** and upload them manually via Spotify's web/mobile app.

**üìñ Having trouble?** See [COVER_ART_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](COVER_ART_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed solutions.

### Content-Driven Generation (Recommended)

> **üö® BEFORE GENERATING: Read [references/COVER_ART_LLM_GUIDE.md](references/COVER_ART_LLM_GUIDE.md) for complete instructions!**

**Analyze playlist content to determine contextually appropriate colors:**

```python
from cover_art_generator import CoverArtGenerator

# Initialize generator (uses same credentials as SpotifyClient)
art_gen = CoverArtGenerator(client_id, client_secret, access_token)

# STEP 1: Read the LLM guide for execution instructions
# Open references/COVER_ART_LLM_GUIDE.md and follow the workflow

# STEP 2: Get playlist content using SpotifyClient
playlist = client.get_playlist("7i9dQZF1DXaXB8fQg7xif")
tracks = playlist['tracks']['items']
artists = [track['track']['artists'][0]['name'] for track in tracks]

# STEP 3: Analyze content characteristics (use guide's mapping tables)
# - Determine genre from artists/tracks
# - Assess energy level (1-10 scale)
# - Identify mood/vibe
# - Apply color psychology from guide

# STEP 4: Generate with analyzed colors
# Example: High-energy rock playlist
# Colors determined using guide's genre/mood tables:
# Rock + High Energy (9/10) + Intense Mood = Red/Dark gradient

art_gen.create_and_upload_cover(
    playlist_id=playlist['id'],
    title="Beast Mode",           # Large, readable text
    subtitle="Gym",                # Optional subtitle
    gradient_start="#E63946",      # Intense red (high energy rock)
    gradient_end="#1D1D1D",        # Dark background (rock/metal)
    text_color="#FFFFFF"           # Maximum contrast (WCAG AA)
)
```

### Quick Presets (Legacy)

20+ preset themes with mood-appropriate color schemes:

```python
# Mood themes: summer, chill, energetic, dark, romantic, melancholic,
#              euphoric, peaceful, intense, dreamy, nostalgic, party, etc.
art_gen.create_and_upload_cover(
    playlist_id=playlist['id'],
    title="Chill Vibes",
    theme="chill"  # Blue/teal gradient
)
```

### Genre-Based Cover Art

15+ genre-specific color schemes:

```python
# Genres: rock, pop, jazz, classical, electronic, hip-hop, country,
#         indie, metal, r&b, blues, folk, reggae, punk, soul
art_gen.create_and_upload_cover(
    playlist_id=playlist['id'],
    title="Rock Classics",
    genre="rock"  # Red/black gradient
)
```

### Artist-Specific Cover Art

Preset colors for popular artists/bands:

```python
# Artists: beatles, pinkfloyd, radiohead, queen, nirvana, davidbowie,
#          ledzeppelin, acdc, therollingstones, fleetwoodmac
art_gen.create_and_upload_cover(
    playlist_id=playlist['id'],
    title="Best of Queen",
    artist="queen"  # Regal gold/burgundy
)
```

### Complete Workflow: Create Playlist with Cover Art

```python
from spotify_client import SpotifyClient
from cover_art_generator import CoverArtGenerator

# STEP 1: Initialize both clients (use same credentials)
client = SpotifyClient(client_id, client_secret, access_token)
art_gen = CoverArtGenerator(client_id, client_secret, access_token)

# STEP 2: Get current user's ID (needed to create playlist)
user_id = client.get_current_user()["id"]

# STEP 3: Create a new playlist
playlist = client.create_playlist(
    name="Summer Rock Anthems",
    description="High-energy rock hits for summer",
    public=True  # Make playlist visible to others
)
print(f"Created playlist: {playlist['name']} (ID: {playlist['id']})")

# STEP 4: Search for tracks and add to playlist
rock_tracks = client.search_tracks("summer rock", limit=50)
track_ids = [t['id'] for t in rock_tracks]
client.add_tracks_to_playlist(playlist['id'], track_ids)
print(f"Added {len(track_ids)} tracks")

# STEP 5: Generate and upload custom cover art
# Uses large text optimized for thumbnails + genre-appropriate colors
art_gen.create_and_upload_cover(
    playlist_id=playlist['id'],
    title="Summer Rock",      # Main title (large text)
    subtitle="2024 Anthems",  # Optional subtitle (smaller text)
    genre="rock"              # Uses rock color scheme (red/black)
    # Alternatives: theme="energetic" or artist="acdc" or custom colors
)
print(f"‚úì Cover art uploaded")

# STEP 6: Print playlist URL for user to view
print(f"‚úì Playlist ready: {playlist['external_urls']['spotify']}")
```
```

### Cover Art Design Features

- **Large typography**: 60-96px font size scaled to text length for thumbnail readability
- **Automatic text wrapping**: Long titles intelligently break across multiple lines at word boundaries (max 20 chars/line)
- **80% text width**: Text spans 80% of cover width (480px on 600px canvas)
- **Smart spacing**: Elements positioned to prevent overlap, with dynamic vertical spacing for multi-line titles
- **Theme-appropriate colors**: Automatic color selection based on mood, genre, or artist
- **Gradient backgrounds**: Radial gradients with decorative accent shapes
- **Auto-optimization**: Images automatically compressed to meet Spotify's <256KB requirement

## Advanced Operations

### Get Recommendations

```python
# Get AI-powered music recommendations based on seed artists/tracks/genres
recommendations = client.get_recommendations(
    seed_artists=["artist_id_1"],  # Spotify IDs of artists
    seed_tracks=["track_id_1"],    # Spotify IDs of tracks
    limit=50                       # Number of recommendations to get
)
# Returns: List of recommended tracks similar to the seeds
```

### Access User Profile

```python
# Get information about the current authenticated user
profile = client.get_current_user()
# Returns: user_id, display_name, email, followers, images, country, etc.
print(f"Logged in as: {profile['display_name']}")
print(f"User ID: {profile['id']}")
```

### Get User's Top Items

```python
# Get user's most played artists over different time periods
top_artists = client.get_top_items(
    item_type="artists",
    limit=20,
    time_range="medium_term"  # Options: short_term (~4 weeks), medium_term (~6 months), long_term (~years)
)
print(f"Top artist: {top_artists[0]['name']}")

# Get user's most played tracks
top_tracks = client.get_top_items(
    item_type="tracks",
    limit=20,
    time_range="short_term"  # Recent listening (last ~4 weeks)
)
print(f"Most played track: {top_tracks[0]['name']} by {top_tracks[0]['artists'][0]['name']}")
```

### Playback Control

```python
# STEP 1: Start playback of a playlist or album
client.start_playback(
    device_id="device_123",                      # Optional: specific device
    context_uri="spotify:playlist:playlist_id",  # What to play (playlist/album/artist URI)
    offset=0                                     # Optional: start at track 0
)

# STEP 2: Pause playback
client.pause_playback(device_id="device_123")

# STEP 3: Skip to next track
client.next_track(device_id="device_123")

# STEP 4: Check what's currently playing
current = client.get_currently_playing()
if current and current.get('item'):
    track = current['item']
    print(f"Now playing: {track['name']} by {track['artists'][0]['name']}")
else:
    print("Nothing is currently playing")
```
```
