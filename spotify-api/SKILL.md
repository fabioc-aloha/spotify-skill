# Spotify API Skill

**Version**: 0.9.0 | **Release Date**: October 22, 2025

## Overview

**This skill directly interacts with the Spotify Web API to manage music and playlists.**

### ‚ö° Unique Capability: Image Generation

**üé® This skill can GENERATE IMAGES** - something Claude cannot do natively! It creates custom SVG-based cover art for Spotify playlists with large, readable typography optimized for thumbnail viewing. Each cover art is dynamically generated with theme-appropriate colors, gradients, and text layouts.

Use this skill when you need to:
- üé® **Generate cover art images** - Create custom playlist covers (Claude's built-in image generation limitation is bypassed!)
- üéµ **Create playlists** from artist names, themes, or specific songs
- üîç **Search** for tracks, artists, albums
- ‚ûï **Add/remove tracks** from playlists
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Control playback** (play, pause, skip)
- üìä **Get user data** (profile, top tracks, listening history)

**When to use this skill:** The user wants you to create a playlist, search for music, manage their Spotify account, **or generate custom cover art images**.

**When NOT to use this skill:** The user is asking you to build a React app or export data files. For app development, refer to ADVANCED_USAGE.md separately.

## Core Capabilities

1. **üé® Cover Art Image Generation** - Generate custom images with SVG ‚Üí PNG conversion (Claude cannot generate images natively!)
2. **Intelligent Playlist Creation** - Create playlists by artist, theme, lyrics, or song list
3. **Playlist Management** - Create, list, update, delete playlists
4. **Search & Discovery** - Find tracks, artists, albums, playlists
5. **Track Management** - Add/remove tracks, get recommendations
6. **Playback Control** - Play, pause, skip, control volume
7. **User Library** - Access saved tracks, profile, listening history

## Quick Start

All Spotify API operations use the `SpotifyClient` class from `scripts/spotify_client.py`. The client handles OAuth authentication and provides methods for all operations.

### Prerequisites

**1. Enable Network Access (REQUIRED)**

‚ö†Ô∏è **This skill requires network access to reach api.spotify.com**

In Claude Desktop, you must enable network egress:
- Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Developer** ‚Üí **Allow network egress**
- Toggle it **ON** (blue)
- Under "Domain allowlist", choose either:
  - **"All domains"** (easiest), OR
  - **"Specified domains"** and add `api.spotify.com` (more secure/restricted)
- This allows the skill to make API calls to Spotify's servers

Without network access enabled, API calls will fail with connection errors.

**2. Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- `requests>=2.31.0` - HTTP requests for Spotify Web API
- `python-dotenv>=1.0.0` - Environment variable management
- `cairosvg>=2.7.0` - SVG to PNG conversion for **image generation**
- `pillow>=10.0.0` - Image processing for **cover art creation**

> **üí° Note:** The `cairosvg` and `pillow` packages enable **image generation** - allowing this skill to create cover art images even though Claude cannot generate images natively!

### Basic Setup

The easiest way to initialize the client is using credentials from environment variables (loaded from `.env` file):

```python
from spotify_client import create_client_from_env

# Initialize client from environment variables (.env file)
client = create_client_from_env()

# If you have a refresh token, refresh the access token
if client.refresh_token:
    client.refresh_access_token()
```

Alternatively, you can manually provide credentials:

```python
from spotify_client import SpotifyClient

# Initialize with credentials directly
client = SpotifyClient(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    redirect_uri="http://localhost:8888/callback",
    refresh_token="YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"  # if available
)

# Refresh to get current access token
if client.refresh_token:
    client.refresh_access_token()
```

### Common Operations

**List user playlists:**
```python
playlists = client.get_user_playlists(limit=50)
```

**Create a new playlist:**
```python
playlist = client.create_playlist(
    name="My Awesome Playlist",
    description="A curated collection",
    public=True
)
```

**Search for tracks:**
```python
results = client.search_tracks(query="artist:The Beatles", limit=20)
```

**Add tracks to playlist:**
```python
client.add_tracks_to_playlist(
    playlist_id="playlist_123",
    track_ids=["track_1", "track_2", "track_3"]
)
```

## Playlist Creation Workflows

### By Artist/Band Name

Create a playlist containing all or most popular tracks by a specific artist:

```python
# Search for artist
artists = client.search_artists(query="The Beatles", limit=1)
artist_id = artists[0]['id']

# Get artist's top tracks
tracks = client.get_artist_top_tracks(artist_id=artist_id, limit=50)
track_ids = [t['id'] for t in tracks]

# Create playlist and add tracks
playlist = client.create_playlist(name="The Beatles Collection")
client.add_tracks_to_playlist(playlist['id'], track_ids)
```

### By Theme/Mood

Create thematic playlists by searching for tracks matching mood keywords:

```python
# Search by theme
theme_queries = [
    "genre:indie mood:chill",
    "genre:indie year:2020-2024"
]

all_tracks = []
for query in theme_queries:
    results = client.search_tracks(query=query, limit=50)
    all_tracks.extend(results)

# Create playlist with theme-matched tracks
playlist = client.create_playlist(name="Chill Indie Evening")
track_ids = [t['id'] for t in all_tracks[:100]]
client.add_tracks_to_playlist(playlist['id'], track_ids)
```

### By Lyrics Content

Search for tracks with specific lyrical themes using Spotify's search:

```python
# Search by lyrical content (Spotify search can include lyrics)
queries = ["love", "heartbreak", "summer", "midnight"]
all_tracks = []

for keyword in queries:
    results = client.search_tracks(query=keyword, limit=20)
    all_tracks.extend(results)

# Remove duplicates and create playlist
unique_track_ids = list(set(t['id'] for t in all_tracks))
playlist = client.create_playlist(name="Love & Heartbreak")
client.add_tracks_to_playlist(playlist['id'], unique_track_ids[:100])
```

### From Specific Song List

Create a playlist from a user-provided list of track URIs or search terms:

```python
# User provides song names or URIs
song_list = ["Shape of You", "Blinding Lights", "As It Was"]

track_ids = []
for song_name in song_list:
    results = client.search_tracks(query=song_name, limit=1)
    if results:
        track_ids.append(results[0]['id'])

# Create playlist
playlist = client.create_playlist(name="My Favorites")
client.add_tracks_to_playlist(playlist['id'], track_ids)
```

## üé® Cover Art Image Generation

> **‚ö° UNIQUE CAPABILITY: This skill can generate images!**
>
> Claude cannot generate images natively, but this skill bypasses that limitation by creating custom SVG graphics and converting them to PNG images. This enables you to generate professional-looking playlist cover art with:
> - Large, readable typography (60-96px fonts) optimized for thumbnails
> - **Automatic text wrapping** - Long titles break across multiple lines intelligently
> - Theme/genre/artist-appropriate color schemes (30+ presets)
> - Automatic layout optimization with 80% text width
> - Smart element spacing to prevent overlap
> - SVG ‚Üí PNG conversion with auto-optimization for Spotify's requirements
>
> **This is real image generation**, not just visualization descriptions!

> **üìã BEST PRACTICES FOR COVER ART GENERATION:**
>
> When a user requests cover art for a playlist:
>
> 1. **For Vague Requests** - If the playlist name is generic ("My Playlist", "Good Music", "Vibes"), ASK clarifying questions:
>    - What genres are in this playlist?
>    - What's the mood or context? (workout, relaxation, party, study)
>    - Any specific era or style? (80s, modern, vintage)
>
> 2. **For Long Titles** (>25 characters) - Text wrapping is automatic, but consider:
>    - Abbreviating common words ("and" ‚Üí "&")
>    - Using smaller fonts proportionally
>    - Breaking into multiple lines at natural word boundaries
>
> 3. **Always Verify** - After generation, confirm the design meets these requirements:
>    - Text readable at thumbnail size (64x64px minimum)
>    - High contrast (4.5:1 ratio minimum)
>    - Genre-appropriate styling
>    - Professional appearance
>
> **üìö Complete LLM Guide:** For comprehensive instructions on creating high-quality cover art, see [references/COVER_ART_LLM_GUIDE.md](references/COVER_ART_LLM_GUIDE.md). This guide includes:
> - Step-by-step execution process
> - Template selection logic
> - Typography rules and positioning
> - Animation implementation (optional)
> - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
> - Error recovery strategies
> - Sample execution flows

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Required Scope for Upload

**To upload cover art to Spotify, you MUST have the `ugc-image-upload` scope enabled:**

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Select your app
3. Ensure `ugc-image-upload` scope is included in your authorization
4. Re-run OAuth flow to get a new refresh token with this scope: `python get_refresh_token.py`
5. Update your `.env` file with the new refresh token

**Without this scope:** You'll get a 401 error when trying to upload. However, you can still **generate cover art images locally** and upload them manually via Spotify's web/mobile app.

**üìñ Having trouble?** See [COVER_ART_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](COVER_ART_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed solutions.

**The skill automatically generates custom cover art with large, readable typography optimized for thumbnail viewing.**

Use `cover_art_generator.py` to create visually appealing covers that match the playlist's mood, theme, genre, or artist:

```python
from cover_art_generator import CoverArtGenerator

# Initialize generator (uses same credentials as SpotifyClient)
art_gen = CoverArtGenerator(client_id, client_secret, access_token)

# Generate and upload cover art in one step
art_gen.create_and_upload_cover(
    playlist_id=playlist['id'],
    title="Summer Vibes",      # Large text (80% width, readable at thumbnail size)
    subtitle="2024",            # Smaller subtitle
    theme="summer"              # Auto-selects appropriate colors
)
```

### Theme-Based Cover Art

20+ preset themes with mood-appropriate color schemes:

```python
# Mood themes: summer, chill, energetic, dark, romantic, melancholic,
#              euphoric, peaceful, intense, dreamy, nostalgic, party, etc.
art_gen.create_and_upload_cover(
    playlist_id=playlist['id'],
    title="Chill Vibes",
    theme="chill"  # Blue/teal gradient
)
```

### Genre-Based Cover Art

15+ genre-specific color schemes:

```python
# Genres: rock, pop, jazz, classical, electronic, hip-hop, country,
#         indie, metal, r&b, blues, folk, reggae, punk, soul
art_gen.create_and_upload_cover(
    playlist_id=playlist['id'],
    title="Rock Classics",
    genre="rock"  # Red/black gradient
)
```

### Artist-Specific Cover Art

Preset colors for popular artists/bands:

```python
# Artists: beatles, pinkfloyd, radiohead, queen, nirvana, davidbowie,
#          ledzeppelin, acdc, therollingstones, fleetwoodmac
art_gen.create_and_upload_cover(
    playlist_id=playlist['id'],
    title="Best of Queen",
    artist="queen"  # Regal gold/burgundy
)
```

### Complete Workflow: Create Playlist with Cover Art

```python
from spotify_client import SpotifyClient
from cover_art_generator import CoverArtGenerator

# Initialize clients
client = SpotifyClient(client_id, client_secret, access_token)
art_gen = CoverArtGenerator(client_id, client_secret, access_token)

# 1. Create playlist
user_id = client.get_current_user()["id"]
playlist = client.create_playlist(
    user_id=user_id,
    name="Summer Rock Anthems",
    description="High-energy rock hits for summer",
    public=True
)

# 2. Add tracks
rock_tracks = client.search_tracks("summer rock", limit=50)
track_ids = [t['id'] for t in rock_tracks]
client.add_tracks_to_playlist(playlist['id'], track_ids)

# 3. Add custom cover art (large text, rock colors)
art_gen.create_and_upload_cover(
    playlist_id=playlist['id'],
    title="Summer Rock",
    subtitle="2024 Anthems",
    genre="rock"  # or theme="energetic" or artist="acdc"
)

print(f"‚úì Playlist created with cover art: {playlist['external_urls']['spotify']}")
```

### Cover Art Design Features

- **Large typography**: 60-96px font size scaled to text length for thumbnail readability
- **Automatic text wrapping**: Long titles intelligently break across multiple lines at word boundaries (max 20 chars/line)
- **80% text width**: Text spans 80% of cover width (480px on 600px canvas)
- **Smart spacing**: Elements positioned to prevent overlap, with dynamic vertical spacing for multi-line titles
- **Theme-appropriate colors**: Automatic color selection based on mood, genre, or artist
- **Gradient backgrounds**: Radial gradients with decorative accent shapes
- **Auto-optimization**: Images automatically compressed to meet Spotify's <256KB requirement

## Advanced Operations

### Get Recommendations

```python
# Get recommendations based on seed artists/tracks
recommendations = client.get_recommendations(
    seed_artists=["artist_id_1"],
    seed_tracks=["track_id_1"],
    limit=50
)
```

### Access User Profile

```python
profile = client.get_current_user()
# Returns: user_id, display_name, email, followers, images, etc.
```

### Get User's Top Items

```python
top_artists = client.get_top_items(
    item_type="artists",
    limit=20,
    time_range="medium_term"  # short_term, medium_term, long_term
)

top_tracks = client.get_top_items(
    item_type="tracks",
    limit=20,
    time_range="short_term"
)
```

### Playback Control

```python
# Start playback
client.start_playback(
    device_id="device_123",
    context_uri="spotify:playlist:playlist_id",
    offset=0
)

# Pause
client.pause_playback(device_id="device_123")
