# Spotify Playlist Cover Art Generator - LLM Execution Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Output Format Limitation

**The cover art is generated as SVG and immediately converted to PNG (static image) for Spotify upload.**

- ‚úÖ **SVG features that work**: Gradients, colors, text, shapes, patterns
- ‚ùå **SVG features that DON'T work**: Animations (`<animate>`, `<animateTransform>`) - these are lost in PNG conversion
- üìä **Final format**: Static PNG image (640x640 pixels)

**DO NOT use SVG animations** - they will not be visible in the final uploaded cover art.

## Overview

This guide enables you to create professional Spotify playlist cover art **by analyzing the playlist's actual content** (tracks, artists, genres) to determine appropriate colors, styles, and mood. You are self-contained and don't need external theme lists or color presets.

## Core Principle: Content-Driven Design

**You will determine colors and style by:**
1. Analyzing the playlist's tracks and artists using the Spotify API
2. Extracting genre, mood, and energy from the actual music
3. Applying color psychology based on the content analysis
4. Creating unique, contextually appropriate designs

This makes you truly autonomous - able to handle any playlist without needing predefined themes.

---

## Step-by-Step Execution Process

### Step 1: Analyze Playlist Content

**FIRST: Get the actual playlist data**

```python
from scripts.spotify_client import SpotifyClient

client = SpotifyClient(access_token="...")

# Get playlist details and tracks
playlist_info = client.get_playlist(playlist_id)
tracks = playlist_info['tracks']['items']

# Extract key information
artists = [track['track']['artists'][0]['name'] for track in tracks if track['track']]
track_names = [track['track']['name'] for track in tracks if track['track']]
```

**ANALYZE THE CONTENT:**
- **Genres**: What genres do these artists represent?
- **Era/Time Period**: What decades are these tracks from?
- **Energy Level**: Are these high-energy or calm tracks?
- **Mood**: Aggressive, romantic, melancholic, upbeat?
- **Common Themes**: Workout, sleep, party, focus, nostalgia?

**EXTRACT KEY CHARACTERISTICS:**
```
Based on playlist content:
- Primary Genre: [determined from artists/tracks]
- Energy Level: [1-10 scale based on track analysis]
- Dominant Mood: [extracted from track names, artists, genres]
- Era/Style: [determined from artist eras]
- Keywords: [2-3 most important words from playlist name]
```

**IF PLAYLIST NAME IS VAGUE** (e.g., "My Favorite Songs"), use the content analysis to understand the theme, then ASK:
```
"I analyzed your playlist and see it contains [genres/artists].
What vibe should the cover art convey? (energetic, chill, nostalgic, etc.)"
```

### Step 2: Determine Colors from Content Analysis

**USE COLOR PSYCHOLOGY based on your Step 1 analysis:**

**Energy Level Mapping:**
- **High Energy (8-10)**: Bright, saturated colors
  - Examples: Bright red (#E63946), electric orange (#FF6B35), hot pink (#FF6B9D)
- **Medium Energy (4-7)**: Balanced, clear colors
  - Examples: Deep blue (#0369A1), vibrant purple (#8B5DFF), teal (#4ECDC4)
- **Low Energy (1-3)**: Muted, soft colors
  - Examples: Soft blue (#A8D8FF), pale green (#B2DFDB), light gray (#E8E8E8)

**Genre-to-Color Mapping:**

Use these associations when you detect genres from the playlist:

| Genre Detected | Color Scheme (gradient_start, gradient_end, text) |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Rock/Metal     | Intense red + Black (#E63946, #1D1D1D, #FFFFFF)  |
| Electronic/EDM | Neon colors (#00FFF0, #8B5DFF, #FFFFFF)          |
| Hip-Hop/Rap    | Purple + Gold (#6A4C93, #FFD93D, #FFFFFF)         |
| Jazz/Blues     | Brown + Cream (#6B4423, #F5F5DC, #2C2C2C)        |
| Classical      | Gold + Navy (#D4A574, #2C3E50, #F5F5DC)          |
| Pop            | Pink + Yellow (#FF6B9D, #FFD93D, #FFFFFF)         |
| Country        | Earth tones (#D4A574, #8B4513, #F5F5DC)          |
| Reggae         | Green + Yellow (#90BE6D, #FFD93D, #1A1A1A)       |
| Indie/Alt      | Muted pastels (#B2DFDB, #E8B4B8, #2C3E50)        |
| Ambient/Chill  | Cool blues (#4ECDC4, #556FB5, #FFFFFF)           |

**Mood-to-Color Mapping:**

| Mood Detected   | Color Temperature | Saturation | Example Scheme            |
|----------------|-------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| Aggressive     | Warm              | High       | Red + Black               |
| Calm/Peaceful  | Cool              | Low        | Soft blue + Light purple  |
| Happy/Upbeat   | Warm              | High       | Yellow + Orange           |
| Melancholic    | Cool              | Low        | Gray + Deep blue          |
| Romantic       | Warm              | Medium     | Pink + Rose               |
| Nostalgic      | Warm              | Low        | Sepia + Vintage gold      |
| Energetic      | Warm/Bright       | High       | Orange + Red              |
| Focus/Study    | Cool              | Low        | Light blue + White        |

**SYNTHESIZE YOUR COLOR SCHEME:**

1. Determine primary mood from playlist content
2. Select base colors from genre/mood mappings
3. Adjust saturation based on energy level
4. Ensure high contrast for text readability

**Example Analysis:**
```
Playlist: "Ultimate Workout Mix"
Content Analysis:
- Artists: Eminem, Metallica, Linkin Park, Rage Against the Machine
- Genres Detected: Rock, Metal, Hip-Hop
- Energy Level: 9/10 (very high energy)
- Mood: Aggressive, Intense, Motivational

Color Decision:
gradient_start = "#E63946"  # Intense red (high energy, aggressive)
gradient_end = "#1D1D1D"    # Almost black (metal/rock aesthetic)
text_color = "#FFFFFF"      # Maximum contrast

Reasoning: High-energy rock/metal requires bold, aggressive colors
with maximum contrast for workout/gym visibility.
```

Reasoning: High-energy rock/metal requires bold, aggressive colors
with maximum contrast for workout/gym visibility.
```

### Step 3: Typography Rules (CRITICAL - NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Font Sizes for Thumbnail Readability:**
1. **Primary word**: 70-90px (LARGE)
2. **Secondary word**: 60-80px
3. **Supporting words**: 40-60px
4. **NEVER** use fonts smaller than 40px

**Text Wrapping (for long titles):**
```python
# Automatic text wrapping at word boundaries
def wrap_text(text, max_chars=20):
    words = text.split()
    lines = []
    current_line = []
    current_length = 0

    for word in words:
        if current_length + len(word) + len(current_line) > max_chars:
            if current_line:
                lines.append(' '.join(current_line))
                current_line = [word]
                current_length = len(word)
        else:
            current_line.append(word)
            current_length += len(word)

    if current_line:
        lines.append(' '.join(current_line))
    return lines
```

**Text Layout:**
- Text occupies **80% of canvas width**
- Line height: **110%** of font size (font_size * 1.1)
- Vertical spacing: **20px between elements**
- Center alignment (both horizontal and vertical)

**Font Weight:**
- Titles: **Bold** (weight: 700-900)
- Subtitles: **Semi-bold** (weight: 600)

---

### Step 4: Generate the Cover Art

**EXECUTE THIS CODE:**

```python
from scripts.cover_art_generator import CoverArtGenerator
from scripts.spotify_client import SpotifyClient

# Initialize
client = SpotifyClient(access_token="...")
generator = CoverArtGenerator(client)

# Generate with colors determined from content analysis
png_path = generator.generate_cover_art(
    title="Workout Power",  # From playlist name
    subtitle="",  # Optional
    gradient_start="#E63946",  # Determined from Step 2
    gradient_end="#1D1D1D",    # Determined from Step 2
    text_color="#FFFFFF",      # High contrast
    output_path="workout_cover.png",
    size=640  # Spotify recommended
)

print(f"‚úì Cover art created: {png_path}")

# Upload to playlist
success = generator.upload_cover_image(
    playlist_id="37i9dQZF1DXaXB8fQg7xif",
    image_path=png_path
)
```

---

### Step 5: Quality Assurance Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

**Readability:**
- [ ] Can you read the title at 100x100px (thumbnail size)?
- [ ] Is there sufficient contrast between text and background?
- [ ] Does text wrap properly (no cutoffs)?
- [ ] Are all words clearly visible?

**Design Quality:**
- [ ] Do colors match the playlist content/mood?
- [ ] Is the gradient direction visually appealing?
- [ ] Does it look professional and polished?
- [ ] Would you click on this in Spotify?

**Technical Requirements:**
- [ ] Image is 640x640px or larger
- [ ] File size < 256KB (Spotify limit)
- [ ] Format is JPEG or PNG
- [ ] Colors are vibrant but not oversaturated

**Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA):**
- [ ] Contrast ratio ‚â• 4.5:1 for normal text
- [ ] Contrast ratio ‚â• 3:1 for large text (>24px)
- [ ] Readable for colorblind users (test with grayscale)

## Complete Workflow Example

### User Request: "Create cover art for my playlist '7i9dQZF1DXaXB8fQg7xif'"

**Step 1: Get Playlist Content**
```python
playlist = client.get_playlist("7i9dQZF1DXaXB8fQg7xif")
playlist_name = playlist['name']  # "Beast Mode Gym"
tracks = playlist['tracks']['items']

# Analyze content
artists = ["Metallica", "Rage Against the Machine", "Linkin Park", ...]
# Detected: High-energy rock/metal
```

**Step 2: Determine Colors from Content**
```
Analysis:
- Genre: Rock + Metal (detected from artists)
- Energy: 9/10 (very high)
- Mood: Aggressive, Intense

Color Decision:
gradient_start = "#E63946"  # Intense red (rock/metal + high energy)
gradient_end = "#1D1D1D"    # Almost black (metal aesthetic)
text_color = "#FFFFFF"      # Maximum contrast
```

**Step 3: Apply Typography**
```
Title: "BEAST MODE" (80px, bold, white)
Subtitle: "GYM" (75px, bold, white)
- Wraps properly if needed
- Occupies 80% width
- Centered vertically
```

**Step 4: Generate**
```python
png = generator.generate_cover_art(
    title="BEAST MODE GYM",
    gradient_start="#E63946",
    gradient_end="#1D1D1D",
    text_color="#FFFFFF",
    size=640
)
```

**Step 5: Verify**
- Check readability at thumbnail size ‚úì
- Verify contrast ratio ‚â• 4.5:1 ‚úì
- Confirm aggressive/energetic feel matches content ‚úì
- Upload to Spotify ‚úì

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Genre Playlists

For playlists with mixed genres, blend color schemes:

```python
# Example: Playlist with Electronic (60%) + Chill (40%) tracks
# Electronic = bright neon colors
# Chill = cool, muted tones
# Blend = Teal to Purple gradient

gradient_start = "#4ECDC4"  # Cool teal (chill influence)
gradient_end = "#8B5DFF"    # Electric purple (electronic influence)
text_color = "#FFFFFF"      # Clean contrast
```

### Era-Specific Design from Content

If tracks are primarily from specific eras:

**80s/90s Detected:**
- Neon colors (cyan, magenta, yellow)
- High saturation
- Example: "#00FFF0" to "#FF00FF"

**Modern/Contemporary:**
- Clean, simple gradients
- Muted or monochrome
- Example: "#F5F5F5" to "#2C2C2C"

**Classic/Vintage (pre-1980):**
- Warm, faded tones
- Lower saturation
- Example: "#D4A574" to "#6B4423"

---

## Edge Cases & Solutions

### Very Long Titles (>25 characters)

**Strategy 1: Multi-line wrapping**
```python
title_lines = wrap_text("My Ultimate Workout Power Hour", max_chars=20)
# Result: ["My Ultimate Workout", "Power Hour"]
```

**Strategy 2: Abbreviate common words**
```python
title = title.replace("The ", "").replace(" and ", " & ")
```

**Strategy 3: Focus on keywords**
```python
# "My Favorite Classic Rock Songs" ‚Üí "CLASSIC ROCK"
keywords = extract_keywords(title)
```

### Empty or Private Playlists

If you cannot access playlist tracks:

1. **Ask for genre/mood**: "I can't access the playlist tracks. What genre and mood should the cover art convey?"
2. **Use playlist name only**: Extract clues from the name itself
3. **Default to universal design**: Use balanced, professional colors

### Special Characters

**Emojis**: Replace with themed graphics or remove
**Symbols** (&, @, #): Encode properly for SVG
**Non-English**: Ensure font supports character set

---

## Color Psychology Reference

Use this when analyzing content:

**Color Temperature:**
- **Warm** (energetic, passionate): Reds, oranges, yellows
- **Cool** (calm, focused): Blues, teals, purples
- **Neutral** (balanced): Grays, beige, muted tones

**Saturation:**
- **High saturation**: Energetic, bold, attention-grabbing
- **Medium saturation**: Balanced, professional
- **Low saturation**: Calm, sophisticated, subtle

**Contrast:**
- **High contrast**: Dramatic, easier to read (rock, workout, party)
- **Low contrast**: Softer, more subtle (ambient, classical, sleep)

**Common Color Meanings:**
- **Red**: Energy, passion, intensity, aggression
- **Orange**: Enthusiasm, creativity, warmth
- **Yellow**: Happiness, optimism, attention
- **Green**: Nature, calm, growth, balance
- **Blue**: Trust, calm, focus, professionalism
- **Purple**: Creativity, luxury, electronic/synthetic
- **Pink**: Romance, softness, pop music
- **Brown**: Earth, vintage, acoustic, organic
- **Black**: Power, sophistication, mystery
- **White**: Clean, minimal, modern, space

## Summary

**You are now self-contained and autonomous for cover art generation.** You don't need preset theme lists - instead, you:

1. **Analyze** the playlist's actual content (tracks, artists)
2. **Extract** genre, mood, and energy from the music
3. **Apply** color psychology based on your analysis
4. **Generate** contextually appropriate cover art
5. **Verify** quality and accessibility

This approach makes you adaptive to any playlist - past, present, or future - by analyzing the actual content rather than relying on predefined themes.
**CRITICAL**: If the playlist name is generic or lacks specific information, ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS before proceeding.

**Vague Request Indicators:**
- Generic terms: "My Favorite Songs", "My Playlist", "Good Music"
- No genre indicators: "Sunday Vibes", "Mood Music", "The Mix"
- Personal/subjective only: "Songs I Love", "Best Ever", "My Jams"
- Single ambiguous words: "Vibes", "Feels", "Energy"

**Required Clarifying Questions (ask ALL that apply):**

```
IF playlist_name_is_vague THEN
    ASK: "What genre(s) of music are in this playlist? (rock, pop, electronic, etc.)"
    ASK: "What's the mood or context? (workout, relaxation, party, study, etc.)"
    ASK: "Any specific era or style? (80s, modern, vintage, etc.)"
    ASK: "Who's the target audience? (personal, friends, specific age group, etc.)"
    WAIT: for_user_response
    THEN: proceed_with_analysis
```

**Example Clarifying Interactions:**

```
INPUT: "My Favorite Songs"
RESPONSE: "I'd love to create cover art for your playlist! To make it perfect, could you tell me:
- What genres of music are included? (rock, pop, hip-hop, etc.)
- What's the vibe or mood? (energetic, chill, nostalgic, etc.)
- Any particular era or style you're going for?
This will help me choose the right colors, fonts, and design elements."

INPUT: "Sunday Vibes"
RESPONSE: "Great playlist name! To design the perfect cover art, I need to know:
- What kind of Sunday vibes? (relaxing morning, upbeat afternoon, cozy evening?)
- What genres fit your Sunday mood? (acoustic, jazz, indie, etc.)
- What visual style appeals to you? (minimalist, colorful, vintage, modern?)
With these details, I can create something that truly captures your Sunday feeling."

INPUT: "Workout Mix"
RESPONSE: "Perfect! I can create energetic cover art for your workout playlist. To nail the design:
- What type of workouts? (running, weightlifting, yoga, cardio?)
- Music genres? (electronic, rock, hip-hop, etc.)
- Preferred energy level? (intense/aggressive, motivational, steady-paced?)
This will help me choose the right visual intensity and color scheme."
```

**Decision Tree for Vague Requests:**
```
IF sufficient_context_available THEN
    PROCEED: to_step_2_template_selection
ELSE IF some_context_but_unclear THEN
    ASK: targeted_clarifying_questions
ELSE IF completely_vague THEN
    ASK: all_clarifying_questions
    SUGGEST: common_playlist_types_as_examples
```

### Step 1.6: Handle Edge Cases
**Critical edge cases that require special handling:**

**Long Playlist Names (>25 characters):**
```
IF character_count > 25 THEN
    STRATEGY: break_into_multiple_lines
    OR: use_smaller_fonts_proportionally
    OR: abbreviate_common_words ("The" ‚Üí "THE", "and" ‚Üí "&")
    ENSURE: still_readable_at_thumbnail_size
```

**Special Characters & Emojis:**
```
IF contains_emojis THEN
    DECISION: keep_emoji_as_visual_element OR replace_with_themed_graphics
    EXAMPLE: "üéµ My Music" ‚Üí Use musical note graphics instead
IF contains_special_chars ["&", "@", "#", etc.] THEN
    ENSURE: proper_SVG_encoding
    AVOID: XML_conflicts
```

**Non-English Playlist Names:**
```
IF language != english THEN
    CONSIDER: cultural_color_associations
    EXAMPLE: Red = luck in Chinese culture, white = mourning in some cultures
    MAINTAIN: readability_for_character_sets
    RESEARCH: genre_conventions_in_that_culture
```

**Inappropriate Content Detection:**
```
IF potentially_inappropriate_content THEN
    APPLY: clean_professional_design
    AVOID: explicit_imagery_or_colors
    FOCUS: typography_and_abstract_elements
    FLAG: for_human_review_if_unsure
```

**Technical Character Limits:**
```
SVG_text_limits:
- Max recommended line: 15-20 characters for readability
- Consider text wrapping at: 18+ characters
- Emergency fallback: acronyms or key words only

Font_fallback_strategy:
IF custom_font_fails THEN use_system_fonts
ENSURE: consistent_weight_and_spacing
```

### Step 2: Choose Design Template
Based on analysis, select template:

```
IF genre contains ["rock", "metal", "heavy"] THEN
    template = "aggressive_metal"
ELSE IF genre contains ["80s", "retro", "electronic", "synth"] THEN
    template = "neon_retro"
ELSE IF genre contains ["sleep", "calm", "relax", "chill"] THEN
    template = "peaceful_dreamy"
ELSE IF genre contains ["medical", "therapy", "healing"] THEN
    template = "clinical_professional"
ELSE
    template = "generic_modern"
```

### Step 3: Apply Typography Rules (CRITICAL)
**ALWAYS execute these typography requirements:**

1. **Font Sizes (Non-negotiable)**:
   - Primary word: 70-90px
   - Secondary word: 60-80px
   - Supporting words: 40-60px
   - NEVER use fonts smaller than 40px

2. **Font Weight**:
   - Use "Arial Black", "Impact", or font-weight: 900
   - Fallback: Arial, sans-serif with weight 800+

3. **Text Coverage**:
   - Typography must cover 80% of the 640x640 canvas
   - Center text in y-coordinates: 150-500 range
   - Leave top 100px and bottom 100px for accents

4. **Text Positioning Template**:
```svg
<text x="320" y="180" font-size="[70-90]">[PRIMARY_WORD]</text>
<text x="320" y="270" font-size="[60-80]">[SECONDARY_WORD]</text>
<text x="320" y="360" font-size="[40-60]">[TERTIARY_WORD]</text>
```

### Step 4: Color Scheme Selection
Execute color selection based on template:

**aggressive_metal**:
- Background: Dark gradients (#000000 to #333333)
- Text: Metallic silver/gold (#f8fafc, #fbbf24)
- Accents: Red, orange (#ef4444, #f97316)

**neon_retro**:
- Background: Dark blue/purple gradients (#1e1b4b to #533483)
- Text: Neon colors (#ff0080, #00ffff, #8b5cf6)
- Accents: Electric/neon variants

**peaceful_dreamy**:
- Background: Soft gradients (#1e293b to #312e81)
- Text: Light blues/whites (#e0e7ff, #ffffff)
- Accents: Warm yellows (#fef3c7)

**clinical_professional**:
- Background: Clean blues/whites (#f0f9ff to #0ea5e9)
- Text: Professional blues (#0369a1, #0284c7)
- Accents: Medical cross elements

### Step 5: SVG Structure Generation
**ALWAYS use this exact structure:**

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="640" height="640" viewBox="0 0 640 640" role="img" aria-labelledby="title desc">
  <title id="title">[PLAYLIST_NAME] - Spotify Playlist Cover</title>
  <desc id="desc">[DESCRIPTION]</desc>

  <defs>
    [GRADIENTS_AND_FILTERS]
  </defs>

  <!-- BACKGROUND (Layer 1) -->
  [BACKGROUND_ELEMENTS]

  <!-- DECORATIVE ELEMENTS (Layer 2) - TOP AREA ONLY -->
  [TOP_ACCENTS y="20-120"]

  <!-- MAIN TYPOGRAPHY (Layer 3) - DOMINANT -->
  [LARGE_TEXT y="150-500"]

  <!-- SPOTIFY LOGO (Layer 4) - BOTTOM RIGHT -->
  [SPOTIFY_LOGO transform="translate(570, 580)"]

  <!-- BOTTOM ACCENTS (Layer 5) -->
  [BOTTOM_ELEMENTS y="520-620"]
</svg>
```

### Step 5.6: Image Integration (Advanced)
**When to use images:**
- Artist-specific playlists (band photos, album art references)
- Themed playlists (vintage vinyl, instruments, nature scenes)
- Genre-specific imagery (microphones for vocals, synthesizers for electronic)

**Image Implementation Methods:**

1. **Base64 Embedded Images** (Recommended for small images):
```svg
<defs>
  <pattern id="albumArt" x="0" y="0" width="1" height="1">
    <image href="data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABA..."
           width="640" height="640" opacity="0.3"/>
  </pattern>
</defs>

<!-- Use as background -->
<rect width="640" height="640" fill="url(#albumArt)"/>
```

2. **External Image References** (Use with caution):
```svg
<image href="https://example.com/image.jpg" x="50" y="50" width="100" height="100" opacity="0.6"/>
```

3. **Clipped Background Images**:
```svg
<defs>
  <clipPath id="imageClip">
    <circle cx="320" cy="180" r="80"/>
  </clipPath>
</defs>

<image href="data:image/..." x="240" y="100" width="160" height="160"
       clip-path="url(#imageClip)" opacity="0.7"/>
```

**Image Guidelines:**
- **Always maintain text readability**: Use opacity 0.2-0.4 for background images
- **Clip images appropriately**: Don't let images interfere with text areas
- **Optimize file size**: Keep base64 images under 50KB
- **Use proper positioning**: Images in top (y=20-120) or bottom (y=520-620) areas only
- **Accessibility**: Include alt descriptions in title/desc tags

**Image Template Applications:**
```
IF playlist_contains_artist_name THEN
    CONSIDER: artist_photo_background (opacity=0.3, clipped)
    POSITION: background_layer_behind_text
ELSE IF genre = "vintage" OR "retro" THEN
    CONSIDER: vinyl_record_graphic (top_corner, small)
    CONSIDER: vintage_texture_overlay (opacity=0.2)
ELSE IF genre = "instrumental" THEN
    CONSIDER: instrument_silhouettes (corner_accents)
ELSE
    SKIP: images (focus_on_typography_and_shapes)
```

**Image Error Prevention:**
- Never place images in text zone (y=150-500)
- Always use opacity ‚â§ 0.6 to maintain contrast
- Test readability with image overlay
- Ensure images don't compete with Spotify logo
- Keep file size reasonable for performance

### Step 5.7: Accessibility & WCAG Compliance
**CRITICAL: All cover art must meet accessibility standards**

**Color Contrast Requirements (WCAG 2.1):**
```
TEXT_CONTRAST_RATIOS:
- Normal text (‚â•18px): minimum 4.5:1 ratio
- Large text (‚â•24px): minimum 3:1 ratio
- Our standard (‚â•40px): target 7:1 ratio for excellence

CONTRAST_TESTING:
foreground_color = text_color
background_color = effective_background_including_overlays
ratio = calculate_luminance_ratio(foreground, background)
IF ratio < 4.5 THEN ERROR("Insufficient contrast for accessibility")
```

**Screen Reader Compatibility:**

**Visual Accessibility:**
- **Color blindness**: Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- **Low vision**: Ensure high contrast, avoid thin fonts
- **Cognitive accessibility**: Keep design clear and uncluttered

**Accessibility Validation:**
```
CONTRAST_CHECK: use_online_contrast_calculator
SCREEN_READER_TEST: verify_title_and_desc_are_meaningful
COLOR_BLIND_TEST: verify_design_works_in_grayscale
```

### Step 5.8: Brand Safety & Legal Compliance
**Avoid legal and brand safety issues:**

**Copyright Considerations:**
- **No copyrighted images**: Use only original graphics or public domain
- **No trademarked logos**: Except the required Spotify logo
- **No celebrity likenesses**: Without proper licensing
- **Artist references**: Use abstract/stylized representations only

**Content Guidelines:**
```
SAFE_CONTENT:
- Abstract geometric shapes ‚úì
- Color schemes and gradients ‚úì
- Typography treatments ‚úì
- Generic musical symbols ‚úì

AVOID_CONTENT:
- Copyrighted album artwork ‚úó
- Band/artist logos ‚úó
- Photography without rights ‚úó
- Explicit or offensive imagery ‚úó
```

**Quality Assurance Protocol:**
```
BRAND_SAFETY_CHECK:
1. Contains_only_original_graphics: TRUE/FALSE
2. Appropriate_for_all_audiences: TRUE/FALSE
3. No_copyright_violations: TRUE/FALSE
4. Professional_appearance: TRUE/FALSE
IF any_false THEN redesign_problematic_elements
```

### Step 5.9: Error Recovery & Fallback Strategies

When primary design approaches fail or produce poor results:

**Automatic Fallbacks**:
1. **Complex Text Layout Issues**: If text doesn't fit ‚Üí Reduce font sizes proportionally (maintain ratios)
2. **Color Contrast Failures**: If contrast < 4.5:1 ‚Üí Switch to high-contrast template (black/white base)
3. **Element Overlap Detection**: If positioning conflicts ‚Üí Use safe positioning matrix
4. **Animation Performance Issues**: If >8 animations ‚Üí Convert to static design with enhanced typography
5. **Image Integration Problems**: If image reduces readability ‚Üí Remove image, enhance geometric elements

**Safe Positioning Matrix** (fallback when conflicts detected):
```
Title: y=200-280 (always safe zone)
Subtitle: y=300-350 (if needed)
Main text: y=380-450 (primary focus)
Decorative top: y=40-140 (above text)
Decorative bottom: y=500-600 (below text)
```

**Emergency Template** (when all else fails):
- Background: Simple gradient or solid color
- Typography: Clean, minimal font hierarchy
- Elements: Single geometric accent (top or bottom)
- Colors: High contrast (white text on dark, or black on light)
- Logo: Standard bottom-right placement

### Step 5.10: Cross-Platform Optimization

**Platform-Specific Considerations**:

1. **Mobile Apps**: Ensure 32x32px readability (ultra-thumbnail test)
2. **Desktop Apps**: Optimize for both light and dark themes
3. **Web Player**: Consider loading speed (optimize SVG size)
4. **Smart Displays**: High contrast for TV viewing distance

**SVG Optimization**:
- Remove unnecessary decimal places (round to 1 decimal)
- Combine similar elements into groups
- Use `<defs>` for reusable gradients/filters
- Minimize path complexity where possible

### Step 5.11: Quality Assurance Protocol

**Pre-Generation Checks**:
1. Input completeness verification
2. Template compatibility assessment
3. Color scheme validation
4. Typography feasibility check

**Post-Generation Validation**:
1. Automated contrast testing
2. Thumbnail simulation (64x64, 32x32)
3. Animation performance check
4. Accessibility screen reader test
5. Visual balance assessment

**Quality Score Calculation**:
- Readability: 30 points (thumbnail test, contrast, typography)
- Design Quality: 25 points (balance, cohesion, genre matching)
- Technical Excellence: 20 points (code quality, optimization)
- Accessibility: 15 points (WCAG compliance, motion sensitivity)
- Brand Compliance: 10 points (logo placement, guidelines)

Minimum passing score: 80/100

</g>
```

### Step 8: Quality Assurance Execution
Before finalizing, verify:

1. **Thumbnail Test**: Will text be readable at 64x64px?
2. **Overlap Check**: Are decorative elements in top/bottom zones only?
3. **Contrast Verification**: Is text clearly visible against background?
4. **Genre Alignment**: Does design match musical style?

## Error Prevention Protocol

### Common LLM Mistakes to Avoid:
1. **Font Size Errors**: Never use fonts smaller than 40px
2. **Overlap Issues**: Keep decorative elements away from y=150-500
3. **Low Contrast**: Always test text visibility
4. **Missing Spotify Logo**: Include in every design
5. **Generic Design**: Must match musical genre
6. **Poor Typography Hierarchy**: Primary text must be largest
7. **Image Overlap**: Never place images in text zone (y=150-500)
8. **High Image Opacity**: Keep images ‚â§ 0.6 opacity to maintain text contrast

### Validation Commands:
```
IF font_size < 40 THEN ERROR("Font too small for thumbnail")
IF text_y_position BETWEEN 150 AND 500 AND decorative_element_overlaps THEN ERROR("Element overlap detected")
IF contrast_ratio < 4.5 THEN ERROR("Insufficient contrast")
IF spotify_logo_missing THEN ERROR("Spotify logo required")
IF image_y_position BETWEEN 150 AND 500 THEN ERROR("Image in text zone - readability compromised")
IF image_opacity > 0.6 THEN ERROR("Image too opaque - text contrast insufficient")
IF image_file_size > 100KB THEN WARNING("Large image may affect performance")

- [ ] Identified when request lacks sufficient detail
- [ ] Asked appropriate clarifying questions
- [ ] Waited for user response before proceeding
- [ ] Used clarification to inform design decisions
- [ ] Avoided making assumptions about unstated preferences

**Remember**: Better to ask for clarification than to create generic, inappropriate cover art. The goal is to create designs that truly represent the music and user's intent while maintaining professional quality and accessibility standards.

**Note**: The cover art is generated as SVG and then converted to PNG format for upload to Spotify. Any SVG animations are not preserved in the final PNG image.
