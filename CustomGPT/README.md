# Spotify Custom GPT Action

This directory contains an OpenAPI specification that allows OpenAI Custom GPTs to **directly call the Spotify Web API** using OAuth 2.0 authentication.

## üìã Overview

This Custom GPT Action enables your GPT to:
- ‚úÖ Create, read, update, and delete playlists
- ‚úÖ Add and remove tracks from playlists
- ‚úÖ Search for tracks, artists, albums, and playlists
- ‚úÖ Get artist information and top tracks
- ‚úÖ Get music recommendations
- ‚úÖ Control playback (play, pause, skip)
- ‚úÖ Get current playback state

**No API server required!** The GPT talks directly to Spotify using built-in OAuth 2.0.

### ü§ñ Designed for GPT-5 Success

This action is optimized for AI comprehension with:
- **Clear decision trees** for operation selection
- **Explicit format examples** (URI conversion, object notation)
- **Step-by-step workflows** with sample API responses
- **Batching vs pagination** guidance
- **Error recovery patterns** with user-friendly messages
- **Comprehensive knowledge base** (511 lines) with 6 detailed workflows

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add the Action (1 minute)

1. In the **Configure** tab, scroll to **Actions**
2. Click **Create new action**
3. **Import from URL:** (paste this)
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabioc-aloha/spotify-skill/main/CustomGPT/spotify-playlist-action.json
   ```

   **OR** manually copy the contents of `spotify-playlist-action.json` and paste it

4. Click **Save** (at bottom)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure OAuth Authentication (2 minutes)

After saving your action, you'll see the **Authentication** section.

**Fill out the form as follows:**

| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Authentication Type** | OAuth | Select the third radio button |
| **Client ID** | `<your_spotify_client_id>` | From Spotify Dashboard |
| **Client Secret** | `<your_spotify_client_secret>` | From Spotify Dashboard |
| **Authorization URL** | `https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize` | Copy exactly |
| **Token URL** | `https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token` | Copy exactly |
| **Scope** | *(see below)* | Should auto-populate from spec |
| **Token Exchange Method** | Default (POST request) | Keep the default selected |

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Authentication Type:** Select **OAuth** (the third radio button)

2. **Client ID:** Paste your Spotify Client ID from Step 1

3. **Client Secret:** Paste your Spotify Client Secret from Step 1

4. **Authorization URL:** Enter exactly:
   ```
   https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize
   ```

5. **Token URL:** Enter exactly:
   ```
   https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
   ```

6. **Scope:** ChatGPT should auto-populate this from the OpenAPI spec. If it's empty, manually enter (space-separated):
   ```
   user-read-private user-read-email playlist-read-private playlist-read-collaborative playlist-modify-public playlist-modify-private user-library-read user-top-read user-read-playback-state user-modify-playback-state user-read-currently-playing ugc-image-upload
   ```

   **Note:** The `ugc-image-upload` scope is required for uploading custom playlist cover art. All other scopes are for standard playlist and playback operations.

7. **Token Exchange Method:** Keep **"Default (POST request)"** selected

8. **IMPORTANT - Update Spotify Redirect URI:**
   - ChatGPT will show you a callback URL at the top (looks like: `https://chat.openai.com/aip/g-xxxxx/oauth/callback`)
   - **Copy this URL**
   - Go back to your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Open your app ‚Üí Click **Settings**
   - Under **Redirect URIs**, click **Edit**
   - **Add** the callback URL you copied
   - Click **Add** then **Save**

9. Back in ChatGPT, click **Save** at the bottom of the Authentication section

> **üìù Note:** This setup uses the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow, which is the standard for web applications. ChatGPT will:
> 1. Redirect users to Spotify for authentication
> 2. Exchange the authorization code for access/refresh tokens
> 3. Automatically refresh tokens when they expire
> 4. Securely store tokens per user

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Test Your GPT! (30 seconds)

1. Click **Test** in the top right of the GPT builder
2. Try: "Search for songs by Queen"
3. Click **Allow** when prompted to authenticate with Spotify
4. Try: "Create a playlist called 'My Awesome Mix'"

üéâ **Done!** Your Spotify Custom GPT is ready!

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **OAuth 2.0:** Users authenticate directly with Spotify
- **Token Management:** ChatGPT handles token refresh automatically
- **Permissions:** Only requested scopes are granted
- **Privacy:** No third-party servers involved - direct Spotify API calls

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### OAuth Authentication Issues

**"Authentication failed" or "Invalid client"**
- Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correct (no extra spaces)
- Make sure you're using credentials from the correct Spotify app
- Check that the redirect URI in Spotify matches exactly what ChatGPT shows

**"Redirect URI mismatch" error**
- The callback URL must **exactly match** between ChatGPT and Spotify
- Format: `https://chat.openai.com/aip/g-xxxxx/oauth/callback`
- After adding to Spotify, click **Save** in the Spotify Dashboard
- Wait a few seconds, then try authenticating again

**Scope configuration**
- ChatGPT should auto-populate scopes from the OpenAPI spec's `securitySchemes` section
- If the Scope field is empty, manually enter the required scopes (space-separated)
- Required scopes: `user-read-private user-read-email playlist-read-private playlist-read-collaborative playlist-modify-public playlist-modify-private user-library-read user-top-read user-read-playback-state user-modify-playback-state user-read-currently-playing`
- Do NOT leave the scope field blank - authentication will fail without proper scopes

**Token Exchange Method**
- Use **"Default (POST request)"** (recommended)
- Only use "Basic authorization header" if you have specific requirements

### API Usage Issues

**"Invalid URI" errors when adding tracks**
- Spotify requires URIs in format: `spotify:track:{track_id}`
- Not just the track ID: ‚ùå `7qiZfU4dY1lWllzX7mPBI`
- Correct format: ‚úÖ `spotify:track:7qiZfU4dY1lWllzX7mPBI`

**"Forbidden" or "Insufficient scope" errors**
- The OAuth token may not have required permissions
- Try re-authenticating (start a new conversation with the GPT)
- Some operations require Spotify Premium (e.g., playback control)

**GPT not finding playlists**
- The GPT needs to search through your playlists first with GET /me/playlists
- For large libraries, may need pagination (offset parameter)
