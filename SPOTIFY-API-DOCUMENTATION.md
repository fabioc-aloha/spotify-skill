## Authentication & Setup

The foundation of any Spotify Web API integration begins with proper authentication and setup. This section covers the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow, scope management, and client configuration. Understanding authentication is crucial as it determines what your application can access and modify in user accounts. Spotify uses different authorization flows depending on your application type, with the Authorization Code Flow being the most common for web applications that need to access user data.

### Required Scopes
```python
# Essential scopes for playlist and library management
basic_scope = "playlist-modify-public playlist-modify-private user-library-read"

# Complete scopes for full functionality (verified against official Spotify documentation)
extended_scope = """
    playlist-modify-public playlist-modify-private playlist-read-private
    playlist-read-collaborative user-library-read user-library-modify
    user-read-private user-read-email user-top-read user-read-recently-played
    user-follow-read user-follow-modify user-read-playback-state
    user-modify-playback-state user-read-currently-playing streaming
    app-remote-control ugc-image-upload user-read-playback-position
"""
```

### Authentication Setup
```python
import spotipy
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth

def setup_spotify_client():
    """Complete Spotify client setup with full scopes."""
    return spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth(
        client_id="your_client_id",
        client_secret="your_client_secret",
        redirect_uri="http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback",
        scope=extended_scope
    ))

# Authorization Flow Notes (Updated October 2025):
# - Authorization Code Flow: ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED for web apps (most common)
# - Authorization Code with PKCE: ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED for mobile/desktop apps (no client secret needed)
# - Client Credentials Flow: ‚úÖ For server-to-server applications (no user data access)
# - Implicit Grant Flow: ‚ùå REMOVED - Use PKCE instead (deprecated since 2023)

# ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY BEST PRACTICES (2025):
# 1. ALWAYS use PKCE for client-side apps (mobile, desktop, single-page apps)
# 2. Never expose client secrets in client-side code
# 3. Use short-lived access tokens with refresh token rotation
# 4. Implement proper token storage (secure keychain/keystore)
# 5. Use HTTPS for all redirect URIs in production
```

### PKCE Authentication (Recommended for Client Apps)
```python
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyPKCE

def setup_spotify_client_with_pkce():
    """
    Set up Spotify client with PKCE authentication (more secure).
    Recommended for mobile and desktop applications.
    """
    return spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyPKCE(
        client_id="your_client_id",
        redirect_uri="http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback",
        scope=extended_scope
    ))
    # Note: No client_secret needed - more secure for client-side apps
```

## API Compatibility & Updates

> **Important**: Spotify regularly updates their Web API. This section tracks deprecated and removed endpoints.

### Current Environment
- **Spotify Web API**: Latest (October 2025)
- **Spotipy Library**: v2.25.1+ (actively maintained)
- **Python**: 3.8+ (recommended 3.10+)
- **Documentation Last Updated**: October 29, 2025
- **Test Coverage**: 16/16 endpoints tested (14 working, 2 deprecated)

### API Change Summary (2025)

**Major Changes**:
1. ‚ùå **Audio Analysis Endpoints Removed** - `audio_features()`, `audio_analysis()` no longer functional
2. ‚ùå **Recommendation Engine Disabled** - `recommendations()`, `recommendation_genre_seeds()` return 404
3. ‚ùå **Browse Features Removed** - `featured_playlists()`, `category_playlists()` no longer available
4. ‚ùå **Related Artists Disabled** - `artist_related_artists()` returns 404
5. ‚úÖ **Core Functionality Intact** - All playlist, search, user profile, and library endpoints fully functional

**Impact Assessment**:
- ‚úÖ **14/16 tested endpoints working** (87.5% success rate)
- ‚úÖ **100% of core features operational** (playlists, search, user data)
- ‚ùå **Audio intelligence features unavailable** (requires third-party solutions)
- ‚ùå **Spotify's recommendation engine unavailable** (requires custom algorithms)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated Endpoints (Still Functional)
These methods still work but are deprecated and may be removed in future versions:

| Method | Status | Replacement | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| `user_playlist_create()` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated | Use with caution | Still functional, modern approach recommended |
| `playlist_tracks()` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated | `playlist_items()` | Use `playlist_items()` for consistency |

### ‚ùå Removed/Non-Functional Endpoints (Empirically Tested October 2025)

These endpoints are documented as "OAuth 2.0 Deprecated" but are **completely non-functional**.
All requests return HTTP 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found errors. Testing confirmed with spotipy 2.25.1.

**üß™ EMPIRICAL TEST RESULTS** (October 1, 2025):

| Method | Documentation Status | API Response | HTTP Error | Test Date | Replacement |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `audio_features()` | OAuth 2.0 Deprecated | ‚ùå **FAILS** | 403 Forbidden | Oct 1, 2025 | Use Librosa, Essentia, or AcousticBrainz |
| `audio_analysis()` | OAuth 2.0 Deprecated | ‚ùå **FAILS** | 403 Forbidden | Oct 1, 2025 | Use audio processing libraries |
| `artist_related_artists()` | OAuth 2.0 Deprecated | ‚ùå **FAILS** | 404 Not Found | Oct 1, 2025 | Genre matching + search algorithms |
| `recommendations()` | OAuth 2.0 Deprecated | ‚ùå **FAILS** | 404 Not Found | Oct 1, 2025 | Custom recommendation engine |
| `recommendation_genre_seeds()` | OAuth 2.0 Deprecated | ‚ùå **FAILS** | 404 Not Found | Oct 1, 2025 | Manual genre lists |
| `featured_playlists()` | OAuth 2.0 Deprecated | ‚ùå **FAILS** | 404 Not Found | Oct 1, 2025 | Search with "popular" + genre |
| `category_playlists()` | OAuth 2.0 Deprecated | ‚ùå **FAILS** | 404 Not Found | Oct 1, 2025 | Search-based discovery |

**Testing Methodology**:
- ‚úÖ Valid OAuth 2.0 authentication confirmed (other endpoints work)
- ‚úÖ Latest spotipy library (2.25.1)
- ‚úÖ All other endpoints (user, playlist, search) functional
- ‚ùå All deprecated endpoints consistently return 403/404 errors
- üìä Complete test results: `docs/COMPREHENSIVE_API_TEST_RESULTS.md`

**Important Notes**:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do NOT use these endpoints** - They will always fail
2. üìö **Documentation exists for historical reference only**
3. üîß **Spotipy library still has methods** (but they immediately fail when called)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Code using these endpoints is broken** and requires migration

### Understanding the Status

**What "OAuth 2.0 Deprecated" Actually Means**:
- üìö **Documentation exists** for historical reference
- ‚ùå **Endpoints are removed** from active API
- üîß **Spotipy library still has methods** (but they fail when called)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Code using these will break** with HTTP 403/404 errors

**Why Documentation Still Exists**:
- Spotify maintains archived documentation to help developers understand what changed
- Common practice: keep docs for deprecated/removed features as historical reference
- Helps developers plan migrations and understand API evolution

### Impact on Your Code

**Broken Functionality**:
1. ‚ùå **Audio Features Analysis** - Cannot retrieve acousticness, danceability, energy, valence, tempo
2. ‚ùå **Related Artists Discovery** - Cannot find similar artists through Spotify's algorithm
3. ‚ùå **AI Recommendations** - Cannot use Spotify's recommendation engine
4. ‚ùå **Browse Features** - Cannot access featured playlists or category browsing

**Files Affected**:
- `musical_dna_analyzer.py` - ‚ùå **BROKEN** (uses audio_features, artist_related_artists)
- Custom recommendation systems - ‚ùå **BROKEN** (uses recommendations endpoint)
- Browse/discovery features - ‚ùå **BROKEN** (uses featured_playlists, category_playlists)

### Migration Requirements

**You MUST use alternative approaches**:

### Migration Requirements & Modern Alternatives (2025)

**You MUST use alternative approaches for deprecated functionality**:

#### **For Audio Features Analysis** ‚Üí Third-Party Audio Intelligence

Since Spotify removed `audio_features()` and `audio_analysis()`, use these alternatives:

**Option 1: Librosa (Python Audio Analysis)**
```python
import librosa
import numpy as np

def analyze_audio_file(audio_path):
    """Extract audio features from local audio file."""
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_path)

    # Tempo (BPM)
    tempo, _ = librosa.beat.beat_track(y=y, sr=sr)

    # Spectral features
    spectral_centroids = librosa.feature.spectral_centroid(y=y, sr=sr)[0]

    # Energy/Loudness
    rms = librosa.feature.rms(y=y)[0]

    # Zero crossing rate (timbre/texture)
    zcr = librosa.feature.zero_crossing_rate(y)[0]

    return {
        'tempo': float(tempo),
        'energy': float(np.mean(rms)),
        'spectral_centroid': float(np.mean(spectral_centroids)),
        'zero_crossing_rate': float(np.mean(zcr))
    }
```

**Option 2: Essentia (Advanced Music Analysis)**
```python
from essentia.standard import *

def analyze_with_essentia(audio_path):
    """Advanced audio analysis with Essentia."""
    loader = MonoLoader(filename=audio_path)
    audio = loader()

    # Rhythm analysis
    rhythm_extractor = RhythmExtractor2013()
    bpm, beats, confidence, estimates, intervals = rhythm_extractor(audio)

    # Key detection
    key_extractor = KeyExtractor()
    key, scale, strength = key_extractor(audio)

    # Danceability
    danceability = Danceability()
    dance_score = danceability(audio)

    return {
        'bpm': bpm,
        'key': key,
        'scale': scale,
        'danceability': dance_score
    }
```

**Option 3: AcousticBrainz API (Cloud-based)**
```python
import requests

def get_acousticbrainz_features(musicbrainz_id):
    """Get audio features from AcousticBrainz (requires MusicBrainz ID)."""
    url = f"https://acousticbrainz.org/api/v1/{musicbrainz_id}/low-level"
    response = requests.get(url)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        return {
            'tempo': data['rhythm']['bpm'],
            'key': data['tonal']['key_key'],
            'danceability': data['rhythm']['danceability']
        }
    return None
```

#### **For Related Artists Discovery** ‚Üí Genre & Search Algorithms

```python
def find_similar_artists(sp, artist_id):
    """Find similar artists using genre matching and search."""
    # Get artist details
    artist = sp.artist(artist_id)
    artist_genres = artist['genres']

    similar_artists = []

    # Search for artists in same genres
    for genre in artist_genres[:3]:  # Use top 3 genres
        results = sp.search(q=f'genre:"{genre}"', type='artist', limit=20)

        for item in results['artists']['items']:
            if item['id'] != artist_id:  # Exclude original artist
                # Calculate genre overlap
                overlap = len(set(item['genres']) & set(artist_genres))

                similar_artists.append({
                    'id': item['id'],
                    'name': item['name'],
                    'genres': item['genres'],
                    'popularity': item['popularity'],
                    'genre_match_score': overlap
                })

    # Sort by genre match and popularity
    similar_artists.sort(
        key=lambda x: (x['genre_match_score'], x['popularity']),
        reverse=True
    )

    return similar_artists[:20]  # Return top 20
```

#### **For Recommendations** ‚Üí Custom Recommendation Engine

```python
def generate_recommendations(sp, user_top_tracks, target_duration=30):
    """Generate recommendations based on user's top tracks."""
    # Analyze user preferences
    user_artists = {}
    user_genres = set()

    for track in user_top_tracks:
        for artist in track['artists']:
            artist_id = artist['id']
            if artist_id not in user_artists:
                artist_details = sp.artist(artist_id)
                user_artists[artist_id] = artist_details
                user_genres.update(artist_details['genres'])

    # Build search queries for similar music
    recommendations = []

    for genre in list(user_genres)[:5]:  # Top 5 genres
        # Search for tracks in this genre
        results = sp.search(
            q=f'genre:"{genre}"',
            type='track',
            limit=20,
            market='US'
        )

        for track in results['tracks']['items']:
            # Filter by duration (if needed)
            duration_min = track['duration_ms'] / 60000
            if target_duration - 1 <= duration_min <= target_duration + 1:
                recommendations.append(track)

    # Sort by popularity and remove duplicates
    seen = set()
    unique_recommendations = []

    for track in sorted(recommendations, key=lambda x: x['popularity'], reverse=True):
        if track['id'] not in seen:
            seen.add(track['id'])
            unique_recommendations.append(track)

    return unique_recommendations[:50]
```

#### **For Browse Features** ‚Üí Advanced Search Strategies

```python
def discover_playlists(sp, genre, mood='popular'):
    """Discover playlists using advanced search."""
    search_terms = {
        'popular': f'{genre} popular hits',
        'new': f'{genre} new releases',
        'classic': f'{genre} classics',
        'workout': f'{genre} workout energy',
        'chill': f'{genre} chill relaxing'
    }

    query = search_terms.get(mood, f'{genre} {mood}')

    results = sp.search(
        q=query,
        type='playlist',
        limit=50,
        market='US'
    )

    return results['playlists']['items']

def discover_new_tracks(sp, genres, year_range=(2023, 2025)):
    """Discover new tracks by genre and year."""
    new_tracks = []

    for genre in genres:
        for year in range(year_range[0], year_range[1] + 1):
            query = f'genre:"{genre}" year:{year}'

            results = sp.search(
                q=query,
                type='track',
                limit=50,
                market='US'
            )

            new_tracks.extend(results['tracks']['items'])

    # Sort by release date and popularity
    new_tracks.sort(
        key=lambda x: (x['album']['release_date'], x['popularity']),
        reverse=True
    )

    return new_tracks
```

## User Profile & Account

This section provides comprehensive access to user account information and listening history. You can retrieve detailed user profiles, analyze listening patterns through top artists and tracks across different time periods, and access recently played music. These endpoints are essential for creating personalized experiences, building user dashboards, and understanding user preferences. The data includes both public information (like display names and follower counts) and private data (like email addresses and detailed listening history), depending on the requested scopes.

### User Information
```python
# Get current user profile
user = sp.current_user()
print(f"User: {user['display_name']} ({user['id']})")
print(f"Followers: {user['followers']['total']}")
print(f"Country: {user['country']}")
print(f"Product: {user['product']}")  # free, premium

# Get any user's public profile
user_profile = sp.user("spotify_user_id")
```

### User Top Items
```python
# Get user's top artists
top_artists = sp.current_user_top_artists(
    limit=50,  # Max 50
    offset=0,
    time_range='medium_term'  # short_term, medium_term, long_term
)

# Get user's top tracks
top_tracks = sp.current_user_top_tracks(
    limit=50,
    time_range='short_term'  # Last 4 weeks
)

# Time ranges:
# - short_term: ~4 weeks
# - medium_term: ~6 months
# - long_term: ~several years
```

### Recently Played
```python
# Get recently played tracks
recent = sp.current_user_recently_played(
    limit=50,  # Max 50
    after=1610000000000,  # Unix timestamp in milliseconds
    before=1620000000000
)

for item in recent['items']:
    track = item['track']
    played_at = item['played_at']
    print(f"{track['name']} by {track['artists'][0]['name']} - {played_at}")
```

---

## Playlists Management

Playlists are at the heart of the Spotify experience, and this section provides complete control over playlist creation, modification, and management. You can create both public and private playlists, add or remove tracks, reorder content, update metadata, and even upload custom cover images. The API supports collaborative playlists and provides detailed track information with flexible field selection. These endpoints are well-suited for building playlist management tools, automated DJ systems, or music curation applications.

### Create Playlists
```python
def create_playlist(sp, name, description="", public=True, collaborative=False):
    """Create a new playlist with full options."""
    user_id = sp.current_user()['id']

    playlist = sp.user_playlist_create(
        user=user_id,
        name=name,
        public=public,
        collaborative=collaborative,
        description=description
    )

    return playlist
```

### Manage Playlist Content
```python
# Add tracks to playlist
track_uris = ["spotify:track:4iV5W9uYEdYUVa79Axb7Rh"]
sp.playlist_add_items(playlist_id, track_uris, position=0)  # Add at beginning

# Remove tracks from playlist
sp.playlist_remove_all_occurrences_of_items(playlist_id, track_uris)

# Reorder tracks in playlist
sp.playlist_reorder_items(
    playlist_id,
    range_start=0,      # Start position
    range_length=5,     # Number of tracks to move
    insert_before=10    # New position
)

# Replace all tracks in playlist
sp.playlist_replace_items(playlist_id, new_track_uris)
```

### Playlist Information & Modification
```python
# Get playlist details
playlist = sp.playlist(playlist_id, fields="name,description,public,collaborative,followers")

# Update playlist details
sp.playlist_change_details(
    playlist_id,
    name="New Playlist Name",
    public=False,
    collaborative=True,
    description="Updated description"
)

# Get playlist tracks with full details
tracks = sp.playlist_tracks(
    playlist_id,
    fields="items(track(name,artists,album,duration_ms,popularity,external_urls))",
    limit=100,
    offset=0
)

# Upload custom playlist cover image
with open("cover_image.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
    sp.playlist_upload_cover_image(playlist_id, image_file.read())
```

### Get User Playlists
```python
# Get current user's playlists
playlists = sp.current_user_playlists(limit=50, offset=0)

# Get any user's public playlists
user_playlists = sp.user_playlists("spotify_user_id", limit=50)
```

### ‚ùå Deprecated: Featured Playlists (REMOVED)
```python
# ‚ùå THIS NO LONGER WORKS - Endpoint removed by Spotify (Oct 2025)
# featured = sp.featured_playlists(
#     country='US',
#     limit=20,
#     offset=0
# )

# ‚úÖ ALTERNATIVE: Use search to find popular playlists
results = sp.search(q='top hits', type='playlist', limit=20, market='US')
for playlist in results['playlists']['items']:
    print(f"{playlist['name']} - {playlist['owner']['display_name']}")
```

## Track & Album Operations

This section focuses on retrieving detailed information about individual tracks and albums, including metadata, popularity scores, and release information. You can access comprehensive track details like duration, explicit content flags, and ISRC codes, as well as album information including release dates, genres, and total track counts. These endpoints are fundamental for music discovery applications, metadata management systems, and building rich music catalogs with detailed information.

### Track Information
```python
# Get single track
track = sp.track("4iV5W9uYEdYUVa79Axb7Rh")
print(f"Track: {track['name']}")
print(f"Artists: {[artist['name'] for artist in track['artists']]}")
print(f"Album: {track['album']['name']}")
print(f"Duration: {track['duration_ms']} ms")
print(f"Popularity: {track['popularity']}")
print(f"Explicit: {track['explicit']}")

# Get multiple tracks
tracks = sp.tracks(["4iV5W9uYEdYUVa79Axb7Rh", "1301WleyT98MSxVHPZCA6M"])
```

### ‚ùå Deprecated: Audio Features (REMOVED)
```python
# ‚ùå THIS NO LONGER WORKS - Endpoint removed by Spotify (Oct 2025)
# audio_features = sp.audio_features("4iV5W9uYEdYUVa79Axb7Rh")[0]
# print(f"Danceability: {audio_features['danceability']}")
# print(f"Energy: {audio_features['energy']}")
# print(f"Valence: {audio_features['valence']}")
# print(f"Tempo: {audio_features['tempo']} BPM")

# ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: Audio features analysis is no longer available via Spotify Web API
# Consider using alternative solutions:
# - External music analysis APIs
# - Audio analysis libraries (e.g., librosa for Python)
# - Pre-computed audio features from third-party datasets
```

### Album Operations
```python
# Get album information
album = sp.album("4aawyAB9vmqN3uQ7FjRGTy")
print(f"Album: {album['name']}")
print(f"Artists: {[artist['name'] for artist in album['artists']]}")
print(f"Release Date: {album['release_date']}")
print(f"Total Tracks: {album['total_tracks']}")
print(f"Genres: {album['genres']}")

# Get album tracks
album_tracks = sp.album_tracks("4aawyAB9vmqN3uQ7FjRGTy", limit=50)

# Get multiple albums
albums = sp.albums(["4aawyAB9vmqN3uQ7FjRGTy", "1DFixLWuPkv3KT3TnV35m3"])

# Get new releases
new_releases = sp.new_releases(country='US', limit=20, offset=0)
```

## Artist & Search

Artist information and search functionality form the backbone of music discovery. This section covers retrieving comprehensive artist profiles, including genres, popularity metrics, and follower counts, as well as accessing their discographies and related artists. The advanced search capabilities support complex queries with filters for year, genre, audio features, and more. These endpoints enable building sophisticated music discovery engines, artist recommendation systems, and genre-based music exploration tools.

### Artist Information
```python
# Get artist information
artist = sp.artist("4NHQUGzhtTLFvgF5SZesLK")
print(f"Artist: {artist['name']}")
print(f"Genres: {artist['genres']}")
print(f"Popularity: {artist['popularity']}")
print(f"Followers: {artist['followers']['total']}")

# Get artist's albums
albums = sp.artist_albums(
    "4NHQUGzhtTLFvgF5SZesLK",
    album_type='album,single,appears_on,compilation',

## Best Practices

Build robust, efficient, and maintainable Spotify integrations with proven development patterns and optimization techniques. This section covers performance optimization strategies, security best practices, proper error handling, and efficient data management. Following these practices ensures your application can handle production workloads, provides excellent user experience, and maintains security standards while making the most efficient use of the Spotify Web API.

### Performance Optimization
```python
# 1. Batch API calls when possible
track_ids = ["id1", "id2", "id3", ...]
features = sp.audio_features(track_ids)  # Better than individual calls

# 2. Use pagination efficiently
def get_all_items(sp, endpoint_func, **kwargs):
    items = []
    offset = 0

        if len(batch['items']) < limit:
            break

def robust_spotify_call(func, *args, max_retries=3, **kwargs):
    """Wrapper for robust API calls with retry logic."""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        except SpotifyException as e:
            if e.http_status == 429:  # Rate limited
                retry_after = int(e.headers.get('Retry-After', 1))
                print(f"Rate limited. Waiting {retry_after} seconds...")
                time.sleep(retry_after)
            elif e.http_status == 401:  # Unauthorized
                print("Token expired. Re-authenticate required.")
                raise
            elif attempt == max_retries - 1:
                print(f"Failed after {max_retries} attempts: {e}")
                raise
            else:
                print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}. Retrying...")
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
            raise
```

### Security Best Practices
```python
# 1. Never hardcode credentials
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
client_id = os.getenv('SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID')
client_secret = os.getenv('SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET')

# 2. Use appropriate scopes (principle of least privilege)
minimal_scope = "playlist-read-private"  # Instead of all scopes

# 3. Handle token refresh automatically
auth_manager = SpotifyOAuth(
    client_id=client_id,
    client_secret=client_secret,
    redirect_uri=redirect_uri,
    scope=scope,
    cache_path=".cache"  # Stores refresh tokens securely
)

# 4. Validate input data
def safe_search(sp, query, search_type='track', limit=20):
    # Sanitize input
    query = query.strip()[:100]  # Limit length
    if not query:
        return {'tracks': {'items': []}}

    try:
        return sp.search(q=query, type=search_type, limit=min(limit, 50))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Search failed: {e}")
        return {'tracks': {'items': []}}
```

## Error Handling

Build resilient applications that gracefully handle API failures, network issues, and rate limiting with comprehensive error management strategies. This section covers common error scenarios, proper exception handling, retry logic, and user-friendly error messaging. Robust error handling is essential for production applications that need to provide consistent user experiences even when facing network connectivity issues, API downtime, or quota limits.

### Common Error Codes
```python
from spotipy.exceptions import SpotifyException

def handle_spotify_errors(func):
    """Decorator for comprehensive error handling."""
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        try:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        except SpotifyException as e:
            error_handlers = {
                400: "Bad Request - Check your parameters",
                401: "Unauthorized - Token expired or invalid",
                403: "Forbidden - Insufficient permissions",
                404: "Not Found - Resource doesn't exist",
                429: "Rate Limited - Too many requests",
                500: "Internal Server Error - Try again later",
                502: "Bad Gateway - Service temporarily unavailable",
                503: "Service Unavailable - Try again later"
            }

            error_msg = error_handlers.get(e.http_status, f"Unknown error: {e.http_status}")
            print(f"Spotify API Error {e.http_status}: {error_msg}")

            if e.http_status == 429:
                retry_after = int(e.headers.get('Retry-After', 60))
                print(f"Retry after {retry_after} seconds")

            raise
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
            raise

    return wrapper
```

## Rate Limits & Optimization

Maximize your application's performance while respecting Spotify's API limits through intelligent request management and optimization strategies. This section covers rate limiting mechanics, request optimization techniques, caching strategies, and parallel processing approaches. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building applications that can handle high user loads while maintaining responsive performance and staying within API quotas.

### Rate Limiting Information
```python
"""
Spotify Web API Rate Limits (Updated January 2025):
- Rate limit calculated on rolling 30-second window (not per minute)
- Development mode: Lower rate limit (exact number varies)
- Extended quota mode: Much higher rate limit (requires application)
- Some endpoints have custom rate limits (e.g., playlist image upload)
- 429 errors include 'Retry-After' header with wait time in seconds

Key Changes from Previous Documentation:
- Rolling 30-second window instead of per-minute calculation
- Different limits for development vs extended quota modes
- Application-specific rate limits based on quota mode

Best Practices:
1. Apply for extended quota mode for production apps
2. Implement backoff-retry strategy using Retry-After header
3. Use batch APIs to reduce request count
4. Cache results and use snapshot_id for playlists
5. Consider lazy loading for UI features
"""

class RateLimitedSpotifyClient:
    def __init__(self, sp):
        self.sp = sp
        self.request_times = []  # Track requests in rolling window

    def make_request(self, method_name, *args, **kwargs):
        import time

        # Clean old requests outside 30-second window
        current_time = time.time()
        self.request_times = [t for t in self.request_times if current_time - t < 30]

        try:
            method = getattr(self.sp, method_name)
            result = method(*args, **kwargs)
            self.request_times.append(current_time)
            return result
        except SpotifyException as e:
            if e.http_status == 429:
                # Use Retry-After header as per official documentation
                retry_after = int(e.headers.get('Retry-After', 30))
                print(f"Rate limited. Waiting {retry_after} seconds...")
                time.sleep(retry_after)
                return self.make_request(method_name, *args, **kwargs)
            raise
```

### Optimization Strategies
```python
def optimize_large_operations():
    """Strategies for handling large datasets efficiently."""

    # 1. Parallel processing for independent operations
    import concurrent.futures

    def process_artist_batch(artist_ids):
        return sp.artists(artist_ids)

    all_artist_ids = ["id1", "id2", ...]  # Large list
    batches = [all_artist_ids[i:i+50] for i in range(0, len(all_artist_ids), 50)]

    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(process_artist_batch, batch) for batch in batches]
        results = [future.result() for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures)]

    # 2. Incremental loading for UIs
    def load_playlist_incrementally(playlist_id, callback):
        offset = 0
        limit = 50

        while True:
            batch = sp.playlist_tracks(playlist_id, offset=offset, limit=limit)
            callback(batch['items'])  # Update UI with batch

            if len(batch['items']) < limit:
                break
            offset += limit

    # 3. Smart caching
    import pickle
    import os
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    def cached_recommendations(cache_file, max_age_hours=24):
        if os.path.exists(cache_file):
            with open(cache_file, 'rb') as f:
                cached_data = pickle.load(f)
                if datetime.now() - cached_data['timestamp'] < timedelta(hours=max_age_hours):
                    return cached_data['data']

        # Generate new recommendations
        recommendations = sp.recommendations(...)

        # Cache results
        with open(cache_file, 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump({
                'timestamp': datetime.now(),
                'data': recommendations
            }, f)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"OAuth 2.0 Deprecated"** badge means "removed but documented"
- üîß **Spotipy has methods** but they fail when called
- ‚ùå **Code using these endpoints WILL BREAK**

**Test Command**:
```bash
python test_deprecated_endpoints.py
# Result: 0/7 endpoints functional
```

**Diagnostic Evidence**:
```python
# Working endpoint (proves auth is valid):
sp.current_user()  # ‚úÖ Returns user data

# Deprecated endpoints (all fail):
sp.audio_features(['track_id'])     # ‚ùå HTTP 403 Forbidden
sp.artist_related_artists('id')     # ‚ùå HTTP 404 Not Found
sp.recommendations(seed_artists=[]) # ‚ùå HTTP 404 Not Found
```

### Key Takeaways (Updated with Facts)
1. **Documentation ‚â† Functionality**: Spotify keeps docs for historical reference even after removal
2. **Empirical Testing Required**: Always test with live API - documentation shows history, not current state
3. **Migration Required**: Code using these endpoints must be refactored with alternatives
4. **No Timeline Available**: Spotify doesn't announce removal dates for deprecated endpoints
5. **Common API Practice**: Archive documentation while removing server-side routes

### Previous Correction (October 1, 2025 - INCORRECT)
~~**Correction**: Updated endpoint status information~~
- ~~‚ö†Ô∏è **Clarification**: Previously listed endpoints as "removed" but they are actually "deprecated but functional"~~
- ~~‚úÖ **Verified**: All deprecated endpoints remain operational as of October 2025~~

**This was incorrect** - endpoints are actually non-functional. Updated with empirical test results above.
